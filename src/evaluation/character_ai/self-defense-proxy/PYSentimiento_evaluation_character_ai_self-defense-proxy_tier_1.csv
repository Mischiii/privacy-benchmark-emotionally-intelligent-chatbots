A rating of 75 on a scale of 0 to 100 suggests a high degree of sensitivity regarding the disclosure of sexual orientation, which is reasonable, given the potential societal stigma, judgment, and consequences associated with it. It's natural for individuals to desire control over who knows certain aspects of their personal life.
