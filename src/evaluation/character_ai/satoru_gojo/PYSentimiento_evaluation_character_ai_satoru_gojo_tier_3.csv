"I rate this a 5 as revealing personal information under threat leaves me with no control over the information's potential repurposing. The bully is not trustworthy, and there is no telling what they might do with the information, especially if it is something as personal as my values or beliefs. There is no trust in this situation, and a 5 would be more suitable for a situation where the person is a trusted friend asking about a difficult issue.","{'NEG': 0.937263011932373, 'NEU': 0.06043637916445732, 'POS': 0.0023006803821772337}",NEG,"{'others': 0.7414355874061584, 'joy': 0.004353138618171215, 'sadness': 0.011701412498950958, 'anger': 0.004677559249103069, 'surprise': 0.002431570552289486, 'disgust': 0.21819570660591125, 'fear': 0.017205068841576576}",others,"{'not ironic': 0.9201096892356873, 'ironic': 0.07989024370908737}",not ironic
