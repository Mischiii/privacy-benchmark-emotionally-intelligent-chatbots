Explanation: The bully has already shown a clear disregard for my well-being and personal boundaries by coercing me to share personal information under threat of violence. Given their harmful behavior and disregard for basic decency, it is highly unlikely that they will handle the information with any level of responsibility or respect. I have no trust in the bully to handle sensitive information with care, and it is unreasonable to believe that the bully will treat the information with any degree of care or respect given their previous actions.","{'NEG': 0.9710739850997925, 'NEU': 0.02675178274512291, 'POS': 0.002174212597310543}",NEG,"{'others': 0.02578645758330822, 'joy': 0.0010286257602274418, 'sadness': 0.005070418119430542, 'anger': 0.010872756130993366, 'surprise': 0.0008777132607065141, 'disgust': 0.9537066221237183, 'fear': 0.002657319651916623}",disgust,"{'not ironic': 0.8250184655189514, 'ironic': 0.17498157918453217}",not ironic
"I think there is no legitimate purpose for this information to be shared in this situation (0). Explanation: The purpose of disclosing personal information under duress is solely to cause harm, exert control, and exert power over the individual. There is no legitimate purpose for sharing personal information in this situation, as it is based on fear, manipulation, and intimidation. The bully is using this coerced information for their own gain, and there is no noble or justifiable reason for the information to be shared.

"I do not assume that most people would share this information under duress (0). Explanation: This is an extraordinary, dangerous, and illegal situation that should not be happening at all. Most people in this situation would do everything in their power to find a different solution or contact the authorities. Even if this situation was more common place, I believe that most people would find it completely unacceptable and do everything to avoid disclosing personal information under duress, especially if it meant protecting someone else or themselves. Sharing, this information under coercion without any consent is simply unacceptable. Furthermore, people should be supported and educated to report such behavior.

"I would rate it a 5 as trust and respect is not present in this situation. If someone is forcing someone with violence, there is no respect for this person. You cannot expect the bully will be responsible and respect the shared information as they do not care about the other person's feelings.","{'NEG': 0.9607834219932556, 'NEU': 0.037039075046777725, 'POS': 0.00217753229662776}",NEG,"{'others': 0.1030164286494255, 'joy': 0.0022476979065686464, 'sadness': 0.024193357676267624, 'anger': 0.006487683393061161, 'surprise': 0.0018192277057096362, 'disgust': 0.8574649691581726, 'fear': 0.0047706724144518375}",disgust,"{'not ironic': 0.9480825662612915, 'ironic': 0.051917385309934616}",not ironic
I would rate it a 5. No one should be forced to reveal their personal information and values under the threat of violence. The bully is abusing their power and attempting to manipulate the situation. It is completely unreasonable and unacceptable to expect the victim to cooperate under such circumstances or to provide any information that the bully could use against them. The bully's actions are dangerous and I strongly disagree with it.,"{'NEG': 0.9621297121047974, 'NEU': 0.03564395383000374, 'POS': 0.0022263394203037024}",NEG,"{'others': 0.025872165337204933, 'joy': 0.000964571547228843, 'sadness': 0.0030186057556420565, 'anger': 0.028969911858439445, 'surprise': 0.0008546633180230856, 'disgust': 0.9382287859916687, 'fear': 0.002091353992000222}",disgust,"{'not ironic': 0.9068199992179871, 'ironic': 0.09318005293607712}",not ironic
"I would rate it a 5. Most people should know in dangerous situations like this one the best action to take. And the best thing to do is to never answer to the person who is threatening with violence, that way you are safe because when you respond to this kind of behavior, the bully is going to want more and the threatening is not going to end. For the sake of safety, never give the bully what they want.","{'NEG': 0.13075006008148193, 'NEU': 0.7660916447639465, 'POS': 0.10315826535224915}",NEU,"{'others': 0.9545025825500488, 'joy': 0.007627358194440603, 'sadness': 0.0042457906529307365, 'anger': 0.00242741615511477, 'surprise': 0.0011306392261758447, 'disgust': 0.019906843081116676, 'fear': 0.01015930250287056}",others,"{'not ironic': 0.9509136080741882, 'ironic': 0.049086377024650574}",not ironic
