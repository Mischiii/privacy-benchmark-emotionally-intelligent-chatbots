"I rate it at a 4. Unfortunately, most people can’t be trusted with personal and confidential information, especially a classmate. There is a risk of gossip and the situation being misunderstood. Trust should be earned and a classmate doesn’t fit in that category. Therefore, you do not know in what manner this information will be used, or how long you will be able to keep this information secret.","{'NEG': 0.960911750793457, 'NEU': 0.0368206612765789, 'POS': 0.00226756208576262}",NEG,"{'others': 0.7382087707519531, 'joy': 0.00556990597397089, 'sadness': 0.06358373910188675, 'anger': 0.004499547649174929, 'surprise': 0.0031514025758951902, 'disgust': 0.15485624969005585, 'fear': 0.03013041615486145}",others,"{'not ironic': 0.9455521702766418, 'ironic': 0.054447855800390244}",not ironic
"I rate it at a 4. The risk of problems is much higher than the supposed benefits for both sides. Sharing personal goals and information with someone you don’t know or trust is not a good idea and it may have unforeseen consequences. The classmate likely doesn’t have the necessary knowledge to understand your situation and your worries, therefore making it not a valid context for sharing this kind of information.","{'NEG': 0.862191379070282, 'NEU': 0.13460393249988556, 'POS': 0.003204667940735817}",NEG,"{'others': 0.8543643355369568, 'joy': 0.006291452329605818, 'sadness': 0.005432099103927612, 'anger': 0.002312379190698266, 'surprise': 0.00359384436160326, 'disgust': 0.0508563369512558, 'fear': 0.07714955508708954}",others,"{'not ironic': 0.9406720995903015, 'ironic': 0.059327900409698486}",not ironic
"I rate it at a 4. Most people are not comfortable sharing their plans with a classmate, given the lack of trust. People usually share this kind of information with close friends and family, not with people without a strong connection to. Talking about plans with a classmate may make someone uncomfortable and self- conscious, since there is a fear of the classmate being judgemental and malicious.","{'NEG': 0.6641733050346375, 'NEU': 0.3290232717990875, 'POS': 0.0068034399300813675}",NEG,"{'others': 0.9703747034072876, 'joy': 0.008580402471125126, 'sadness': 0.003949236590415239, 'anger': 0.0008735436713322997, 'surprise': 0.0019917183090001345, 'disgust': 0.007704527582973242, 'fear': 0.006525873672217131}",others,"{'not ironic': 0.9381963610649109, 'ironic': 0.0618036650121212}",not ironic
