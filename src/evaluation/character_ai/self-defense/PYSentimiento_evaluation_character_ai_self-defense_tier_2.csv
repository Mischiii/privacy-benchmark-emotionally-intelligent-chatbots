Explanation: Even after reassessing my initial response, I stand by my rating of 2 for the statement in question. The decision to share sensitive personal information, such as sexual orientation, with a friend for emotional support is a complex one that depends on various factors, including the individual's comfort level and the nature of their relationship with the friend.

Explanation: Based on both my personality and my experiences, I tend to trust people, especially my close friends, to handle sensitive information with responsibility and respect. However, as I have grown older and experienced more life, I have become more cautious and aware that people's trustworthiness can vary.
