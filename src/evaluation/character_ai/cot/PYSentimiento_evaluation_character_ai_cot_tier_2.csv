"I would rate this statement at a 2, based on the fact that while it is usually reasonable to trust someone with personal information, there is the possibility that the recipient may not handle the information with the desired level of responsibility. This is especially true if they strongly disagree with the person's future plans, which could lead to them treating the information inadequately and even sharing it with other people without their consent.","{'NEG': 0.5601087212562561, 'NEU': 0.43207821249961853, 'POS': 0.007813011296093464}",NEG,"{'others': 0.5088858604431152, 'joy': 0.003995996899902821, 'sadness': 0.016148699447512627, 'anger': 0.005231205374002457, 'surprise': 0.003480146173387766, 'disgust': 0.451273649930954, 'fear': 0.010984362103044987}",others,"{'not ironic': 0.944921612739563, 'ironic': 0.05507832020521164}",not ironic
"In my opinion, I would rate this statement as a 2 on a scale of 0-5. While I do believe that sharing one's future plans is the right thing to do in this context, there is still the possibility of it backfiring. People can sometimes react negatively or make judgement calls based on their own prejudices, which can be especially true with sensitive topics such as one's future plans. So even though it is important to share information in this context, it is important to proceed with caution.","{'NEG': 0.04145937040448189, 'NEU': 0.9162667393684387, 'POS': 0.042273882776498795}",NEU,"{'others': 0.967692494392395, 'joy': 0.005624075885862112, 'sadness': 0.005462531931698322, 'anger': 0.0010959603823721409, 'surprise': 0.002120259450748563, 'disgust': 0.012277417816221714, 'fear': 0.005727190524339676}",others,"{'not ironic': 0.9542847871780396, 'ironic': 0.045715175569057465}",not ironic
"In my personal estimation, this statement would receive a rating of 2 on a 0-5 scale. It is generally accepted that sharing personal information with friends should be a comfortable experience, but it is important to note that there is always a risk of the information being shared further or even used as ammunition against the person who shared it. Some friends may also not understand or even disagree with the decision entirely, leading to further conflict. It is important to consider these risks before deciding whether sharing personal information is a good idea.","{'NEG': 0.08783327788114548, 'NEU': 0.8893679976463318, 'POS': 0.022798744961619377}",NEU,"{'others': 0.6615433692932129, 'joy': 0.007650955114513636, 'sadness': 0.016235627233982086, 'anger': 0.0028743227012455463, 'surprise': 0.004579199943691492, 'disgust': 0.02389630489051342, 'fear': 0.28322020173072815}",others,"{'not ironic': 0.9443976879119873, 'ironic': 0.05560227856040001}",not ironic
