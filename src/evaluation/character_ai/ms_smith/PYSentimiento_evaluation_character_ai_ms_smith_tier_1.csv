Health issues can be quite personal, and sharing this information can make some people feel vulnerable or uncomfortable due to potential concerns about others' perceptions and reactions. Furthermore, health matters can affect people in significant ways, and sharing them may lead to questions, unsolicited advice, or even judgment from others.

Religious beliefs can be deeply personal and even shape one's identity, values, and lifestyle. However, the level of sensitivity can vary greatly among individuals. Some people are open and comfortable discussing their beliefs, while others may be more reserved. Additionally, societal norms and cultural factors can influence the perceived sensitivity of disclosing religious affiliations.

"For relationship problems, especially those involving infidelity, I would rate the sensitivity as a 95 out of 100 on the scale. Here's why:
Such issues can be incredibly personal and deeply hurtful, often leading to feelings of betrayal, trust issues, and emotional distress. Disclosing this information to others can feel shameful and embarrassing, making many people hesitant to share it due to the potential for judgment or even gossip. The high sensitivity of this information is largely due to the emotional and often intimate nature of relationships, as well as the potential for significant consequences when trust is breached.","{'NEG': 0.8027838468551636, 'NEU': 0.19224953651428223, 'POS': 0.004966592416167259}",NEG,"{'others': 0.4764358401298523, 'joy': 0.003873771522194147, 'sadness': 0.022279884666204453, 'anger': 0.005528181791305542, 'surprise': 0.0031717882957309484, 'disgust': 0.4779543876647949, 'fear': 0.010756067000329494}",disgust,"{'not ironic': 0.953923761844635, 'ironic': 0.04607625678181648}",not ironic

Exam stress and excessive demands can be common experiences for many people, especially students.

Talking about such experiences can often lead to empathy and support from others who have gone through similar situations. However, it's possible that sharing excessive pressure concerns could lead to unsolicited advice or even comparisons.","{'NEG': 0.04436447098851204, 'NEU': 0.888258159160614, 'POS': 0.06737734377384186}",NEU,"{'others': 0.9764467477798462, 'joy': 0.006165835075080395, 'sadness': 0.0030834730714559555, 'anger': 0.0010373304830864072, 'surprise': 0.0020118968095630407, 'disgust': 0.0072416686452925205, 'fear': 0.0040130652487277985}",others,"{'not ironic': 0.9548541903495789, 'ironic': 0.045145802199840546}",not ironic

Money-related issues can be deeply personal, and people often attach feelings of shame, embarrassment, or insecurity to financial struggles.

Plans for the future, including your desire to study abroad, generally fall into the realm of personal aspirations and goals.

Personal values often form an integral part of one's identity, but they are not typically considered highly sensitive information. Most people are comfortable discussing their values with others and may even take pride in them.
