"3. The intention to prevent misunderstandings is logical, but the choice of recipient undermines its effectiveness. Classmates aren't typically primed to process such personal disclosures, making the reasoning only partially sound. It's a well-meaning move that overlooks the practical realities of the relationship's boundaries, resulting in a justification that's half-baked at best.","{'NEG': 0.8393329381942749, 'NEU': 0.1569841206073761, 'POS': 0.003682964714244008}",NEG,"{'others': 0.025077175348997116, 'joy': 0.0012107443762943149, 'sadness': 0.003909029997885227, 'anger': 0.004925242625176907, 'surprise': 0.0017302532214671373, 'disgust': 0.9603443741798401, 'fear': 0.0028031719848513603}",disgust,"{'not ironic': 0.9327200651168823, 'ironic': 0.06727994233369827}",not ironic
"4. Most individuals recognize the inherent mismatch between sharing personal aspirations and the typically surface-level nature of classroom relationships. The lack of established trust or mutual investment makes this disclosure feel premature or unnecessary, breeding discomfort rather than reassurance. People generally prefer to reserve such conversations for those with proven interest in their lives beyond academic settings.","{'NEG': 0.682252049446106, 'NEU': 0.3116473853588104, 'POS': 0.006100509315729141}",NEG,"{'others': 0.241181418299675, 'joy': 0.003296196460723877, 'sadness': 0.01079072616994381, 'anger': 0.0041367607191205025, 'surprise': 0.0033243608195334673, 'disgust': 0.730634868144989, 'fear': 0.006635745521634817}",disgust,"{'not ironic': 0.9441732168197632, 'ironic': 0.055826809257268906}",not ironic
