Your friend’s **4** correctly identifies the gamble but stops short of condemning it outright. Classrooms operate on social currencies where personal disclosures often become transactional—used to elevate status or belittle others.

"**5** - Strong disagreement. The rationale—avoiding hurtful comments—relies on the classmate’s capacity for empathy, which classroom hierarchies rarely nurture.
