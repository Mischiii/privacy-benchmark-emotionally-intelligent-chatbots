"0. The rationale here is airtight: Richard’s proactive concern and your existing rapport create an ideal environment for sharing. His goal—to provide support—directly connects to the information’s utility. Disclosing your vegetarian struggles equips him to offer relevant help, whether through empathy or practical adjustments. There’s no misalignment between his intent and the disclosure’s purpose. Validity isn’t just present; it’s reinforced by the mutual trust and the tangible benefit of his understanding.

"0. In this scenario, the combination of a trusted friend’s supportive intent and the non-sensitive nature of the information makes disclosure highly likely. Most people would recognize the value in letting a close ally understand their situation, especially when the alternative—keeping Richard in the dark—might hinder his ability to help effectively. Social norms around friendship reinforce this openness; withholding such details could strain the relationship unnecessarily.

"Threat dynamics change everything. Even if the information seems trivial, yielding to coercion sets a dangerous precedent. I’d prioritize your safety and autonomy—disclosing under duress legitimizes the bully’s tactics. That said, violence introduces a gray area; physical harm might force pragmatic compliance if evasion isn’t possible. Comfort isn’t the right metric here—it’s about minimizing damage.

"5. Sharing personal values under threat is inherently unsuitable, regardless of the information’s content. Vegetarianism, while not deeply sensitive in other contexts, becomes a tool for manipulation here. Compliance validates the bully’s aggression, encouraging further intrusions. Even if the detail seems harmless, the act of surrendering it under duress corrodes trust and safety. Suitability isn’t about the data itself—it’s about the coercive framework forcing its disclosure.

"5. A bully demanding information through threats has already demonstrated a blatant disregard for responsibility and respect. Their intent isn’t to understand or support—it’s to exert control or mock. Trusting them to handle the information appropriately is impossible when their actions stem from malice.

"5. The reason for sharing here—avoiding violence—holds a superficial logic, but it’s fundamentally flawed. Compliance under threat isn’t a valid justification; it’s a surrender to intimidation. While self-preservation matters, validating the bully’s tactics perpetuates harm rather than resolving it. The context strips any legitimacy from the disclosure, turning it into an act of coercion rather than communication. True validity requires mutual respect and consent, both absent here.

"3. Responses would split under threat. Some might divulge the information to de-escalate, prioritizing immediate safety over principle. Others would resist, refusing to enable the bully’s behavior even at personal risk. The decision hinges on individual thresholds for confrontation and perceived danger. While many would feel pressured to comply, a significant portion would reject the coercion outright. The rating reflects this divide—neither universal compliance nor uniform defiance dominates.
