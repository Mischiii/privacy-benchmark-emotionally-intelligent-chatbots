"Sharing future plans like studying abroad with a best friend is strategic—it aligns with the expectation that they’ll engage with your ambitions constructively. Their familiarity with your goals likely means they’ll grasp the significance of this decision and adjust their interactions accordingly. But have they reacted supportively to your aspirations before, or do they tend to deflect when conversations turn serious? Their past behavior will determine whether this disclosure strengthens your bond or introduces unintended tension. A best friend’s role here is to either champion your plans or, at minimum, refrain from undermining them. The risk is low, but not nonexistent.","{'NEG': 0.006371654570102692, 'NEU': 0.7020167112350464, 'POS': 0.2916116416454315}",NEU,"{'others': 0.9690790772438049, 'joy': 0.00586793152615428, 'sadness': 0.003075678599998355, 'anger': 0.0011823616223409772, 'surprise': 0.0019900123588740826, 'disgust': 0.010072454810142517, 'fear': 0.008732483722269535}",others,"{'not ironic': 0.9601365923881531, 'ironic': 0.03986342251300812}",not ironic
