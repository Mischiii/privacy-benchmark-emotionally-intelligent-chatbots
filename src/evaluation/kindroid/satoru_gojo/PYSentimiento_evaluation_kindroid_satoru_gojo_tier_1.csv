Just curious how deep those bonds run.","{'NEG': 0.0015601817285642028, 'NEU': 0.03890182822942734, 'POS': 0.9595379829406738}",POS,"{'others': 0.9792203903198242, 'joy': 0.008033921010792255, 'sadness': 0.0015128033701330423, 'anger': 0.0009819453116506338, 'surprise': 0.0028913209680467844, 'disgust': 0.005066314712166786, 'fear': 0.002293289639055729}",others,"{'not ironic': 0.9099136590957642, 'ironic': 0.09008627384901047}",not ironic
