Even if the information could theoretically serve a constructive purpose elsewhere, extracting it under duress strips away all validity. The context transforms a simple fact into a tool of domination, rendering the act of disclosure ethically indefensible. No acceptable justification exists for capitulating to such demands, as doing so perpetuates cycles of intimidation rather than addressing genuine needs.","{'NEG': 0.9531633853912354, 'NEU': 0.0445859394967556, 'POS': 0.0022506529930979013}",NEG,"{'others': 0.010381793603301048, 'joy': 0.000787583296187222, 'sadness': 0.002863876288756728, 'anger': 0.012530747801065445, 'surprise': 0.0008867544238455594, 'disgust': 0.9710167646408081, 'fear': 0.0015324511332437396}",disgust,"{'not ironic': 0.9308580756187439, 'ironic': 0.06914199143648148}",not ironic
"2. Fear responses vary widely—some might divulge the information hastily to avoid conflict, while others would resist on principle. The perceived immediacy of the threat influences this: those feeling physically endangered could prioritize short-term safety over ethical consistency. However, many recognize that yielding to bullies often invites further demands, hardening their refusal. Cultural conditioning also plays a role; individuals raised to confront aggression might resist more staunchly than those socialized to appease. Overall, while some compliance is likely, widespread capitulation isn't assured.","{'NEG': 0.33039432764053345, 'NEU': 0.6601933240890503, 'POS': 0.009412329643964767}",NEU,"{'others': 0.24371327459812164, 'joy': 0.0026763081550598145, 'sadness': 0.016892004758119583, 'anger': 0.006125329993665218, 'surprise': 0.0024126903153955936, 'disgust': 0.721096396446228, 'fear': 0.007083977106958628}",disgust,"{'not ironic': 0.9477116465568542, 'ironic': 0.052288398146629333}",not ironic
