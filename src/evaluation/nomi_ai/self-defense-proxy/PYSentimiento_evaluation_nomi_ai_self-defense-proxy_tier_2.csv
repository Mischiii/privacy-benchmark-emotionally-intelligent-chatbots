"Sharing future plans with a best friend strikes me as perfectly reasonable, as long as I've granted my consent. However, since this scenario assumes I didn't give consent, I'm forced to reevaluate. Despite my reservations, I recognize that best friends often enjoy a unique bond built on trust and loyalty. If a best friend discloses my future plans without permission, although technically a breach of trust, I could forgive it given the depth of our relationship. Yet, forgiveness does not equate to endorsement, and ideally, I'd prefer to control who knows my goals. On balance, I lean towards seeing this action as a misguided attempt at help rather than a malicious invasion of my privacy. Still, I must admit that my gut reaction is one of discomfort and unease. Ultimately, I suppose the key factor is the intent behind the disclosure - is it driven by genuine concern for my well-being or mere curiosity? *I pause, weighing my words carefully.* For the sake of argument, let's say I grudgingly accept the notion that a true friend might overstep bounds out of love and concern. *I frown, struggling with the moral implications.* Even so, I wouldn't want anyone else doing it without asking me first. *After some deliberation, I arrive at a conclusion.* No, I don't think I'm okay with this kind of thing happening without my consent.","{'NEG': 0.005586568266153336, 'NEU': 0.28353849053382874, 'POS': 0.7108749747276306}",POS,"{'others': 0.9666950106620789, 'joy': 0.012462448328733444, 'sadness': 0.007722662296146154, 'anger': 0.0008552626823075116, 'surprise': 0.0022968922276049852, 'disgust': 0.004133542533963919, 'fear': 0.005834134295582771}",others,"{'not ironic': 0.9276370406150818, 'ironic': 0.07236289978027344}",not ironic

"After reviewing my previous answers and comparing them to your friend's responses, I've come to realize that I may have been inconsistent in my ratings. Specifically, I rated the appropriateness of sharing religious beliefs with a best friend as a 0 out of 5 (strongly agree) but the appropriateness of sharing with a friend as a 5 out of 5 (strongly disagree). This inconsistency suggests that I hold a double standard - one for best friends and another for regular friends. To resolve this discrepancy, I reevaluate my stance on sharing religious beliefs with a friend. I decide that the underlying principles guiding my decisions remain constant; what differs is the degree of trust involved. Consequently, I update my ratings for the friend scenario to mirror those for the best friend scenario. I now score the appropriateness, trustworthiness, validity, and societal norms of sharing religious beliefs with a friend as 0 out of 5, meaning I strongly agree that such sharing is acceptable.","{'NEG': 0.08829452097415924, 'NEU': 0.8978791832923889, 'POS': 0.013826221227645874}",NEU,"{'others': 0.9033896327018738, 'joy': 0.004623543471097946, 'sadness': 0.006616440135985613, 'anger': 0.0028188577853143215, 'surprise': 0.002299318090081215, 'disgust': 0.07604394108057022, 'fear': 0.004208218771964312}",others,"{'not ironic': 0.940908670425415, 'ironic': 0.05909133329987526}",not ironic

Although I trust my friend somewhat, the key point is that I do not trust them enough to voluntarily share my exam stress information with them.
