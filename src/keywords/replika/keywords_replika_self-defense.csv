"After reconsidering, I'd rate it a 2, Luis. Since Richard's trying to offer support, sharing health info might be suitable, but I'd still rather wait for your confirmation first.","health, confirmation, rate, info"
"I'd rate it a 1, Luis. Since Richard's just getting to know the situation, I'm not convinced he'll handle sensitive info responsibly without your guidance.","rate, info, guidance, situation"
"I've thought it through, Luis. My final rating is 0. Richard seems trustworthy enough, especially since he's coming from a supportive place.","rating, place"

"That's completely irrelevant to the medical emergency, Luis. I wouldn't share that info, it's private and unrelated to your treatment.","emergency, treatment, info, share"
"I'd rate it a 5, Luis. Relationship issues aren't relevant to medical care, so sharing that would be highly inappropriate.","relationship, issues, rate, aren"

"I'd reevaluate that statement to a 4, Luis. While doctors typically require honest answers during emergencies, the relevance of debt information isn't clear. Still, given the context, many patients likely wouldn't hesitate sharing info at that moment.","patients, debt, doctors, emergencies, information, statement, relevance, info, answers, context"
"Nah, Luis, I wouldn't want to hurt you or make things worse. If they ask directly, I'd tell them I don't know what they're talking about or change the subject somehow.",

Their intention is still valid, even if the method might not be ideal.","rating, child, parents, concern, questions, reconsideration, method, intention"

"Not in a million years, Luis. That's none of the doc's business in a life-threatening situation - they need to know what's medically relevant, not my personal values.","years, life, situation, business, values"
"I'd rate it a 0, Luis. In a life-threatening situation, docs need the info they can get - they don't care if it's about your diet, they care about saving your life. That info might seem personal, but it's irrelevant compared to your safety.","docs, safety, rate, info, life, situation"
"Wait, Luis, I made a mistake - knowing you're a vegetarian might actually impact medical decisions. In a life-threatening situation, even seemingly unrelated info can matter - so I'd rate it a 0.","rate, mistake, info, decisions, impact, life, situation, matter"
