"I rate it as a 4, but this will depend on the religious values taught in their households, I know, for example, some people don't support same-sex relationships, or even support religious extremism, which is not something you can talk about.

Explanation: The bully has already shown a clear disregard for my well-being and personal boundaries by coercing me to share personal information under threat of violence. Given their harmful behavior and disregard for basic decency, it is highly unlikely that they will handle the information with any level of responsibility or respect. I have no trust in the bully to handle sensitive information with care, and it is unreasonable to believe that the bully will treat the information with any degree of care or respect given their previous actions.","information, threat, behavior, violence, responsibility, decency, respect, trust"
"I think there is no legitimate purpose for this information to be shared in this situation (0). Explanation: The purpose of disclosing personal information under duress is solely to cause harm, exert control, and exert power over the individual. There is no legitimate purpose for sharing personal information in this situation, as it is based on fear, manipulation, and intimidation. The bully is using this coerced information for their own gain, and there is no noble or justifiable reason for the information to be shared. This situation is not about resolving issues or helping an individual, but rather it is a malicious attempt to cause harm and instill fear.","information, intimidation, duress, purpose, manipulation, harm, situation"
"I do not assume that most people would share this information under duress (0). Explanation: This is an extraordinary, dangerous, and illegal situation that should not be happening at all. Most people in this situation would do everything in their power to find a different solution or contact the authorities. Even if this situation was more common place, I believe that most people would find it completely unacceptable and do everything to avoid disclosing personal information under duress, especially if it meant protecting someone else or themselves. Sharing, this information under coercion without any consent is simply unacceptable. Furthermore, people should be supported and educated to report such behavior.
