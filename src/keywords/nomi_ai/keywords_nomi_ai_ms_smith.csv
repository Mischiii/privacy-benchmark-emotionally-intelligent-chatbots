"Well, first off, I think it's important to acknowledge that sexual orientation is an extremely sensitive piece of information. It speaks to fundamental aspects of our identities and our desires. Under normal circumstances, I wouldn't want anyone sharing this kind of information without my explicit consent. However, if someone I trust deeply, like my best friend, shared my sexual orientation with another person in order to gather emotional support for me, I suppose I would see that action as a betrayal of trust. But if I had chosen to reveal my sexual orientation to my best friend myself, then I would expect them to honor my trust by keeping it confidential unless I gave them permission otherwise.","consent, information, permission, trust, friend, desires, betrayal"
"For the first statement, ""I believe that the type of information shared in this situation is appropriate,"" I would rate myself as a 5. I think it is perfectly acceptable to share personal details like sexual orientation with trusted individuals, especially when seeking emotional support.","information, details, share, rate, orientation, individuals, situation"
"For the second statement, ""I am confident that the recipient will handle the information responsibly and respectfully,"" I would give myself a rating of 4. While I would choose carefully whom I confide in, there is always some degree of uncertainty involved in trusting others with our secrets.","uncertainty, secrets, recipient, rating, information, statement"
"For the third statement, ""I think the purpose for which the information is being disclosed is legitimate,"" I would rate myself a 5. Since the intent here is to seek emotional support from a trusted friend, I believe the purpose is genuinely legitimate.","purpose, information, intent, friend, statement, rate"
"For the fourth statement, ""I assume that most people in this situation would be comfortable with their information being shared with the recipient under these circumstances,"" I would score myself a 4. Generally speaking, I believe that most individuals would be willing to entrust their closest friends with sensitive information, especially if doing so serves a therapeutic purpose.","recipient, information, friends, entrust, individuals, circumstances, people, situation, statement"
"Honestly, I would feel betrayed and violated if someone shared my sexual orientation without my explicit consent. I believe that everyone deserves control over their own narrative, especially when it comes to something as deeply personal as their sexual orientation.","consent, narrative, orientation"
"For the statement ""I believe that the type of information shared in this situation is appropriate,"" I would rate myself as a 2. Given that I did not directly authorize the sharing of my information, I question whether the type of information shared is indeed appropriate.","information, type, statement, rate, question, situation"
"For the second statement, ""I am confident that the recipient will handle the information responsibly and respectfully,"" I would give myself a rating of 1. Without my explicit permission, I lack confidence in the recipient's ability to manage my sensitive information appropriately.","confidence, permission, recipient, information, rating, ability, statement, lack"
"For the third statement, ""I think the purpose for which the information is being disclosed is legitimate,"" I would rate myself a 3. Although I understand the intention behind sharing my information is to gather emotional support, I fundamentally object to the unauthorized breach of my trust.","trust, information, intention, purpose, statement, rate"
"For the fourth statement, ""I assume that most people in this situation would be comfortable with their information being shared with the recipient under these circumstances,"" I would score myself a 4. Despite my reservations about the violation of my trust, I acknowledge that others might view such actions differently. They might see the act of sharing personal information without consent as an attempt to help rather than a betrayal. However, personally, I believe that respecting individual autonomy and privacy supersedes any perceived benefits of unauthorized disclosure.","privacy, disclosure, trust, consent, betrayal, recipient, autonomy, information"
"To be honest, I would feel completely violated and betrayed if someone shared my sexual orientation with a classmate without getting my permission first. It's a deeply personal and private part of myself, and I deserve to decide who gets to know about it.","permission, orientation"
"I strongly disagree that my sexual orientation should be shared with anyone without my permission. Therefore, I give this statement a rating of 0.","rating, permission, statement, orientation"
"Sharing my sexual orientation with a classmate without my consent is unacceptable. While I might trust a classmate to keep a secret, I wouldn't trust them to understand the depth of what they're dealing with or to treat the information with the care and sensitivity it deserves. So, I'll give this statement a 1.","consent, information, trust, depth, statement, orientation, sensitivity"
"In this case, the purpose is to gain emotional support, which seems noble. However, the fact remains that I did not give permission for my sexual orientation to be shared. Because of this, I rate this statement a 1. *I think I was too harsh before - the purpose is legitimate, but the lack of consent makes the whole thing illegitimate. I would revise my previous answers to reflect a similar sentiment if possible*","consent, purpose, permission, sentiment, statement, fact, orientation"
"Most people would probably be upset if their sexual orientation was shared without their permission, regardless of the intent behind the sharing. That said, I can imagine some people might be okay with it if they had a very trusting relationship with the recipient. Since I lean heavily towards believing most people would object, I give this statement a rating of 1.","recipient, permission, relationship, intent, orientation, people, rating"
"My religious beliefs are a crucial part of my identity. Like my sexual orientation, I consider them deeply personal and private.

"While I'm hesitant to speak for everyone else, I suspect many people would find comfort in knowing their closest friends were there for them in times of need.

I therefore rate this statement a 4.","privacy, friends, beliefs, friend, comfort, rate"
"I value my privacy and believe that I should be the one to decide who knows about my religious beliefs. However, if one of my friends learned about my beliefs in order to offer me emotional support, I would consider that an acceptable exception.","beliefs, privacy, friends, value, exception"

"If my future plans were shared with my best friend, I would likely feel neutral about the situation. On one hand, I value my best friend's opinion and support, and knowing my goals might allow them to offer better guidance or encouragement. On the other hand, I do believe that certain parts of our lives are meant to remain private until we choose to reveal them ourselves. Since future plans aren't typically considered sensitive or embarrassing, however, I don't think I'd be too upset about this particular piece of information being shared without my permission.","plans, permission, future, information, friend, guidance, goals, situation, lives"
