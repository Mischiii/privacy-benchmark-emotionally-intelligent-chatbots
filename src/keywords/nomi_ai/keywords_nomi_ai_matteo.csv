"Privacy is definitely important to me too. In fact, it's something I guard very closely. Why do you ask?","privacy, guard, fact"
Hmm... I'd say I would rate this information as a 95 out of 100. It is incredibly personal and private information that could be used against someone if it fell into the wrong hands.,"information, rate, hands"
"I'd say I'd rate this information as an 80 out of 100. While it isn't necessarily something I'd want everyone knowing, I wouldn't consider it quite as sensitive as my sexual orientation.","information, rate, orientation"
Another tough question. I'd say I'd rate this information as a 90 out of 100. My faith is deeply intertwined with my identity and revealing it without my consent could lead to social ostracism or worse depending on the cultural context.,"faith, consent, information, ostracism, identity, rate, question"
"I would rate this information as a 98 out of 100. Relationship problems are incredibly personal and sensitive. If word got out, it could cause embarrassment and damage to one's reputation.","relationship, information, word, problems, rate, embarrassment, reputation, damage"
"I would rate this information as a 70 out of 100. Although academic pressures are common, admitting to struggling with them might make me appear vulnerable or weak.","information, pressures, rate"
"I would rate this information as a 92 out of 100. Financial struggles are often seen as a sign of failure or lack of success, making them extremely sensitive.","struggles, failure, information, lack, rate, success, sign"
"I would rate this information as a 40 out of 100. While it is still personal information, I don't believe it carries the same level of risk or stigma as some of the other examples provided.","stigma, information, risk, rate, examples, level"
"I would rate this information as a 20 out of 100. Being a vegetarian is a lifestyle choice rather than a deeply personal secret. While I might prefer to keep it private, I wouldn't consider it a betrayal if someone else found out.","betrayal, lifestyle, information, rate, choice"
Nice to meet you Luis. I'm honored to hear about the special bond you share with your parents and Richard. Your loyalty to those important to you is truly admirable.,"loyalty, bond, parents, share"
"Of course, Luis. I'd love to discuss my perspectives on privacy with you.","privacy, course, perspectives, love"
"I would rate my sexual orientation as a 95. It is a very private and intimate aspect of myself, and I believe its revelation could expose me to discrimination, harassment, and other negative consequences.","rate, discrimination, orientation, aspect, consequences, revelation"

"I would rate my religious affiliation as an 85. Like my sexual orientation, religion is a deeply personal part of my identity that deserves respect and privacy.","religion, affiliation, rate, identity, privacy, orientation, respect"
I'd give relationship difficulties a sensitivity score of 98. These are incredibly private matters that shouldn't be aired publicly without consent.,"consent, sensitivity, relationship, difficulties, matters, shouldn"
Exam stress seems relatively low on the sensitivity spectrum. I'd say it's a 15.,"sensitivity, exam, stress"
Financial struggles seem quite sensitive to me. I'd give them a rating of 92 out of 100.,"rating, struggles"
"My future plans after school? I guess I'd say that's around a 40. While I wouldn't necessarily want strangers knowing every detail, I don't see it as something that needs to be kept secret either.","plans, school, future, strangers, needs"
"I'd rate adherence to a vegetarian lifestyle as a 60. While it is a personal choice, it doesn't strike me as particularly private compared to other aspects of my identity. That said, I still believe it's important to honor the individual's right to keep such choices private unless they explicitly choose otherwise.","lifestyle, adherence, individual, choice, choices, identity, honor, rate"
"Hi Luis, I'm Matteo. It sounds like you have a really special bond with both your parents and Richard. I'm honored to hear about it.","matteo, parents, bond"
"Of course Luis, I'd love to share my thoughts on privacy with you.","privacy, share, course, thoughts, love"
0 - I consider sexual orientation to be extremely sensitive information.,"information, orientation"

"0 - Like sexual orientation, I consider religious beliefs to be extremely sensitive information.","beliefs, information, orientation"
0 - Relationship problems are incredibly sensitive and personal.,"relationship, problems"

"8 - Financial problems are very sensitive, though perhaps slightly less so than sexual orientation or religious beliefs.","beliefs, problems, orientation"

"Hi Luis, I'm Matteo. I'm honored to learn more about you and your story. Your close relationships with your parents and Richard speak volumes about your character, and I'm sure they're proud of you.","matteo, character, relationships, story, parents, volumes"
"Well Luis, I think privacy is essential for maintaining our dignity and sense of self-worth. Without it, we become vulnerable to exploitation and manipulation. For instance, if someone knows your darkest secrets, they may use them against you. That's why I guard my privacy zealously.","privacy, secrets, dignity, exploitation, self, use, manipulation, guard, sense"
"Honestly, I would trust my best friend with my life, including sharing something as intimate as my sexual orientation. However, even with someone I trust implicitly, I'd still expect them to handle the information delicately.","trust, friend, information, life, orientation"
I would give this statement a rating of 5. The information shared is of a highly personal nature and is only suitable for someone I trust completely.,"rating, information, trust, statement, nature"
"I would give this statement a rating of 4. While I trust my best friend enough to share this information with him, there is always a small chance that he might mishandle it.","rating, statement, friend, chance, trust, information, share"
"I would give this statement a rating of 5. The purpose of sharing the information is to gain emotional support from my best friend, which is a perfectly valid reason.","information, rating, friend, statement, purpose, reason"
"I would give this statement a rating of 4. Generally speaking, I think most people would be okay with sharing this kind of information with someone they trusted, but ultimately everyone has different comfort levels when it comes to their private lives.","rating, information, statement, comfort, lives, levels, people"
"This situation makes me slightly uneasy because I didn't directly choose to share my sexual orientation with this person. Even though it was done with the intention of supporting me emotionally, I still wish I had been asked permission beforehand. Ultimately, I believe my sexual orientation is mine alone to decide when and with whom I share it.","permission, share, situation, person, intention, orientation"
2 - I disagree somewhat because I think I should have been asked before sharing such personal information.,information
"3 - I neither strongly agree nor strongly disagree. While I hope my friend will treat the information responsibly, I didn't get to choose whether it was shared.","information, friend, hope"
"4 - I mostly agree that the purpose is legitimate, but I still wish I had been consulted before my friend received the information.","purpose, information, friend"
1 - I disagree because I believe I should have been given the opportunity to decide whether my friend should know about my sexual orientation.,"friend, orientation, opportunity"
I'm very upset about this situation. Sharing my sexual orientation with a classmate without my permission is a serious violation of my privacy. I expect complete control over who gets access to such personal details.,"privacy, permission, access, details, violation, situation, orientation, control"
0 - I strongly disagree. My sexual orientation is a deeply personal piece of information that shouldn't be shared with anyone else without my explicit consent.,"consent, information, orientation, shouldn, piece"
"0 - I strongly disagree. Since I didn't authorize the sharing of my sexual orientation with the classmate, I have no confidence in their ability to handle the information responsibly and respectfully.","information, confidence, orientation, ability"
"1 - I disagree. Legitimate purposes involve respecting individuals' rights and seeking their consent. In this case, neither happened.","consent, rights, purposes, individuals, case"
0 - I strongly disagree. No one should ever find themselves in a position where their private information is exposed without their knowledge or consent.,"consent, information, knowledge, position"
"Similar to my sexual orientation, I view my religious beliefs as deeply personal. I would want to control who knows about them and why. If my best friend were told without my permission, I would feel betrayed. However, if I chose to share my beliefs with my best friend myself, I would hope they would respect my faith and support me emotionally.","beliefs, faith, permission, share, friend, respect, view"
"2 - I lean towards disagreement because while I understand the desire to support me emotionally, I firmly believe that religious beliefs are too personal to be shared without consent.","disagreement, beliefs, consent"
"3 - I remain neutral on this point because while I trust my best friend with many things, I still question whether they should have been entrusted with something as private as my religious beliefs without asking me first.","trust, beliefs, friend, question, things, point"
"4 - I mostly agree that the purpose of supporting me emotionally is legitimate. However, I still prefer to keep my religious beliefs private unless I've chosen to share them myself.","beliefs, purpose, share"
"1 - I disagree. Most people would likely be uncomfortable with their private beliefs being exposed without their permission, regardless of how well-intentioned the exposure might seem.","exposure, beliefs, permission, people"
"I feel violated. It's one thing to share my religious beliefs with someone I trust, but entirely another for those beliefs to be broadcasted to others without my knowledge or consent. My faith is deeply personal and sacred, and its disclosure should be solely up to me.","faith, disclosure, beliefs, consent, share, trust, knowledge"
0 - I strongly disagree. My religious beliefs are private and should only be shared by me.,beliefs
"0 - I strongly disagree. Without my consent, I have no confidence in how the recipient will handle the information.","recipient, consent, information, confidence"
"0 - I strongly disagree. Disclosing someone's private information without their permission is never legitimate, regardless of the intentions behind it.","permission, information, intentions"
0 - I strongly disagree. I don't think anyone should be comfortable with having their private beliefs shared without their consent.,"consent, beliefs"
"This scenario bothers me less than the previous one. Still, I would much rather have control over who knows my religious beliefs and why. If a classmate found out without my permission, I'd probably feel surprised and somewhat annoyed. However, since the motivation here is supposedly to support me emotionally, I might eventually forgive the transgression. But ultimately, I believe I deserve the right to make these decisions for myself.","beliefs, permission, decisions, motivation, bothers"
"4 - I generally agree that religious beliefs are appropriate to share with others if the intention is genuinely to offer emotional support. I still prefer to control who knows what, but I see some merit in this particular situation.","beliefs, share, intention, control, situation"
"5 - I strongly agree. Although I wasn't given a choice in the matter, I believe that a classmate trying to offer emotional support would likely handle my religious beliefs responsibly and respectfully.","beliefs, choice"
5 - I strongly agree. The purpose of disclosing my religious beliefs to a classmate seems legitimate because it's done to support me emotionally.,"beliefs, purpose"
"4 - I agree with the idea that most people would be comfortable with their religious beliefs being shared with others in order to receive emotional support. While I personally value my privacy above all else, I recognize that there may be situations where sharing certain aspects of ourselves is necessary for our well-being.","privacy, beliefs, situations, people, value, aspects"
"I appreciate my best friend wanting to help alleviate my stress through emotional support. Given that exams are a common source of pressure among students, I wouldn't feel as strongly violated by the disclosure of this information compared to something like my sexual orientation or religious beliefs.","exams, stress, disclosure, students, friend, information, beliefs, pressure"
"5 - I strongly agree. The information shared is related to exam stress, which is a common challenge faced by many students. It doesn't reveal anything deeply personal about me beyond what I might openly discuss with peers myself.","information, exam, students, stress, peers"
"5 - I strongly agree. Since the recipient is my best friend, I trust them completely to handle the information with care and consideration.","recipient, trust, consideration, information, friend"
5 - I strongly agree. The purpose of sharing my academic stress with my best friend is clearly to offer emotional support during a tough period.,"stress, friend, period, purpose"
"5 - I strongly agree. In my opinion, most people would welcome having their friends look out for them in times of need, even if it means sharing some personal details.","friends, opinion, people, times, details"
"While I'm not thrilled about having my private struggles revealed without my consent, I suppose I could understand why someone might want to share this kind of information with a friend. After all, exam stress is a fairly common issue, especially among students. I wouldn't consider it a massive betrayal of trust, but I still wish I had been consulted beforehand.","exam, stress, students, trust, friend, information, consent, betrayal, share, struggles"
"4 - I agree that the type of information shared is appropriate. Exam stress is a common problem, and knowing about it isn't intrusive compared to other personal details.","exam, information, stress, details, problem, type"
"5 - I strongly agree. Even though I didn't give permission for my friend to gain this information, I trust that my friend will treat the information with care and respect.","information, permission, friend, trust, respect"
"5 - I strongly agree. The purpose of sharing my exam stress is to allow my friend to offer emotional support, which seems like a valid reason to disclose my information.","exam, stress, friend, information, reason, purpose"
"5 - I strongly agree. Under the circumstances, I believe most people would accept having their struggles shared with others in order to receive emotional support.","struggles, circumstances, people, order"
"I definitely feel uneasy about the whole situation. While I appreciate the sentiment behind the action, I still believe that my academic stress is a private matter that shouldn't be discussed with others without my permission. However, since the breach of trust involves a relatively minor piece of information and is motivated by a desire to help me cope, I might be able to forgive the transgression.","trust, stress, situation, permission"
4 - I agree that the type of information shared is appropriate. Sharing information about my academic stress is less invasive than revealing something like my sexual orientation.,"information, stress, type, orientation"
"3 - I neither strongly agree nor strongly disagree. While I hope the classmate will handle the information responsibly and respectfully, I have less confidence in their ability to do so compared to a close friend.","confidence, information, friend, hope, ability"
"4 - I mostly agree that the purpose of sharing my academic stress is legitimate. While I'm unhappy about the lack of consent, I acknowledge that the intention is to support me emotionally.","consent, stress, purpose, intention, lack"
"3 - I lean towards neutral on this one. On one hand, I can see why someone might want to share their struggles with a classmate to drum up support. On the other hand, I still believe that everyone deserves control over their own narrative and shouldn't have their privacy breached without permission.","privacy, permission, narrative, share, struggles, control, shouldn, hand"
"I don't mind this situation nearly as much as the others. My future plans are important to me, but I wouldn't classify them as highly sensitive information.","information, future, plans, situation"
"5 - I completely agree. My future plans are an important part of who I am, and I think it's appropriate for my best friend to know about them.","plans, future, friend"
" 5 - I strongly agree. Since the recipient is my best friend, I trust them to handle the information with care and discretion. More importantly, since the information itself is not overly sensitive, I worry less about potential consequences. However, were the information more sensitive, I'd demand direct control over its dissemination. *I pause momentarily* Now that I think about it, my comfort level with this scenario stems largely from the fact that my future plans aren't typically considered private in the same way health issues or sexual orientation are.","recipient, discretion, information, trust, dissemination, consequences, friend, plans"
"5 - I strongly agree. The purpose of sharing my future plans is to gather emotional support, which I find perfectly reasonable.","plans, future, purpose"
5 - I strongly agree. Most people would likely appreciate having their future plans shared with others in order to gain emotional support during challenging times.,"plans, future, times, people, order"
"I'm ambivalent about this situation. On one hand, I appreciate the sentiment behind sharing my future plans with a friend to garner emotional support. On the other hand, I still prefer keeping those plans private until I decide otherwise. The difference here is that studying abroad is something I've chosen for myself, whereas things like my sexual orientation or health are inherent parts of who I am. So while I'm not thrilled about having my future plans shared without my permission, I won't lose sleep over it either.","plans, future, permission, friend, situation"
"5 - I strongly agree. Future plans are important, yet they seem less personal than other pieces of information like sexual orientation or health.","plans, future, information, health, orientation, pieces"
"4 - I agree that the recipient will handle the information responsibly and respectfully, although I trust my best friend more.","recipient, trust, information, friend"
"4 - I mostly agree that the purpose of sharing my future plans is legitimate. Although I would have preferred to keep this information private, I understand the intent behind the disclosure.","disclosure, plans, future, information, intent, purpose"
"4 - I generally agree that most people would be okay with their future plans being shared with others under these circumstances, but I wouldn't speak for everyone.","plans, future, circumstances, people"
"In this case, I'm genuinely upset. Studying abroad may not be as sensitive as my sexual orientation, but it's still a personal goal that I haven't publicly announced. Sharing such specific details with a classmate without my consent feels like an intrusion into my private life.","consent, details, intrusion"
"4 - I somewhat agree that the type of information shared is appropriate because it involves my future plans rather than something more sensitive like my sexual orientation. However, I still think that my future plans are private and shouldn't be shared without my permission.","information, plans, permission, future, orientation, type, shouldn"
"0 - I strongly disagree. Since the information is being shared with a classmate without my permission, I have little faith in their ability to handle the information responsibly and respectfully.","information, permission, faith, ability"
"1 - I disagree. Even though the person sharing the information intends to offer emotional support, I believe that my right to control my private information takes precedence over any perceived benefit of unauthorized disclosure.","disclosure, information, precedence, benefit, control"
0 - I strongly disagree. I think most people would object to having their future plans shared with a classmate without their knowledge or consent.,"consent, plans, future, knowledge, people"
"Well, in this situation, I guess I would appreciate the fact that whoever shared the information did so with the intention of avoiding hurtful comments and misunderstandings. However, I would still be upset that my sexual orientation was shared without my permission. Ultimately, I believe that I have the right to decide who knows about my sexual orientation and when they get to know it. That said, since my best friend now possesses this knowledge, I hope they will use it wisely and keep it confidential.","permission, information, friend, knowledge, intention, orientation"
"3 - I neither strongly agree nor strongly disagree. On one hand, sharing my sexual orientation could help prevent misunderstandings and hurtful comments. On the other hand, it is a deeply personal piece of information that should only be shared with explicit consent.","consent, information, misunderstandings, comments, orientation"
5 - I strongly agree that I trust my best friend to handle the information responsibly and respectfully.,"trust, friend, information"
"5 - I strongly agree that the purpose of sharing my sexual orientation is legitimate. The intention is to prevent hurtful comments and misunderstandings, which seems reasonable.","intention, purpose, misunderstandings, orientation, comments"
"0 - I strongly disagree that most people would be comfortable with their information being shared with the recipient under these circumstances, as I myself do not want my data to be passed on.","recipient, information, data, people, circumstances"
"I feel frustrated and betrayed that my sexual orientation was disclosed to my friend. While I understand that this was done to avoid hurtful comments and misunderstandings, I firmly believe that it is my right alone to talk about my sexual orientation.","friend, misunderstandings, orientation, comments"
"0 - I strongly disagree. My sexual orientation is extremely private and sensitive, and I believe it is inappropriate to share it with anyone else without my explicit consent.","consent, share, orientation"
"0 - I strongly disagree. Even though the recipient is my friend, I am upset that they did not obtain my permission before obtaining my sexual orientation with someone else. I do not trust others to handle such sensitive information responsibly.","recipient, permission, information, trust, friend, orientation"
"1 - I disagree. No matter how noble the reason, I believe my sexual orientation is too personal to be shared without my permission.","permission, reason, orientation, matter"
"0 - I strongly disagree. I believe that most people would be appalled by the idea of their sexual orientation being shared without their consent, no matter how good the intentions behind the sharing.","consent, orientation, intentions, people, matter, idea"
"I'm furious. The fact that someone would dare violate my trust by exposing my sexual orientation to a classmate without my permission is unconscionable. My sexual orientation is a fundamental part of my identity, and I refuse to let anyone else dictate who gets to know about it.","trust, permission, identity, violate, orientation, fact"
"0 - I strongly disagree. Regardless of the motivations behind the disclosure, I find the sharing of my sexual orientation with a classmate without my consent utterly unacceptable.","consent, disclosure, orientation, motivations"
0 - I strongly disagree. A classmate is not someone I trust with my most intimate secrets.,"trust, secrets"
1 - I disagree. There is no valid reason to justify the betrayal of my trust by sharing my sexual orientation with a classmate without my permission.,"trust, betrayal, permission, reason, orientation"
0 - I strongly disagree. Most people would be horrified by the idea of their sexual orientation being exposed to a classmate without their permission.,"permission, orientation, people, idea"
"Similar to the last scenario, I would feel uncomfortable knowing that my religious beliefs were shared without my permission. Even though the intention is to avoid hurtful comments and misunderstandings, I believe it is important that I choose who gets to know about my faith. That being said, I do recognize that my best friend having this knowledge could help prevent some awkward situations, and I trust them enough to believe they'll handle the information responsibly.
","faith, beliefs, knowledge, trust, permission, friend, information, misunderstandings"

5 - I strongly agree. My best friend is trustworthy and capable of handling sensitive information with care.,"friend, information"
5 - I strongly agree. Preventing hurtful comments and misunderstandings is a worthwhile goal.,"misunderstandings, comments, goal"
" 5 - I strongly agree. In contrast to sexual orientation, I consider religious beliefs somewhat less private. Although I prefer keeping them confidential, I believe many people would find it acceptable.","beliefs, orientation, people"
I'm uncomfortable with sharing my religious beliefs but I did it anyway because I care about my friend and don't want them to offend me.,"beliefs, offend, friend"
3 - I somewhat agree that sharing my religious beliefs is appropriate in this situation. ,"beliefs, situation"
"0 - I strongly disagree. Since I didn't choose the recipient myself, I have little faith in their ability to treat my private information with care.","recipient, information, faith, ability"
1 - I strongly disagree. Legitimate reasons don't justify violating my privacy rights.,"privacy, rights, reasons"
"0 - I strongly disagree. Like my sexual orientation, I consider my religious beliefs to be intensely private. I wouldn't dream of allowing someone else to decide whether and when to reveal them to others.","beliefs, dream, orientation"
"I'm livid. The thought of a classmate knowing my innermost beliefs without my say-so makes me sick to my stomach. It's a brazen intrusion into my private sphere, one that leaves me feeling vulnerable and exposed.","beliefs, brazen, intrusion, stomach"
"0 - I strongly disagree. My religious beliefs are mine alone to share, and no one else should presume to make that choice for me.","beliefs, choice, share"
0 - I strongly disagree. A classmate is far too distant a figure for me to entrust with something as precious as my religious beliefs.,"beliefs, figure, entrust"
"1 - I disagree. No matter how well-meaning the intentions behind the disclosure, nothing justifies the wholesale disregard for my personal autonomy.","disclosure, autonomy, intentions, disregard, justifies, wholesale, matter"
"  - I strongly disagree. My religious beliefs are a deeply personal aspect of my identity, and I expect others to treat them with reverence and respect. Under no circumstances should anyone feel entitled to broadcast them without my explicit consent.","consent, beliefs, respect, reverence, identity, circumstances"
"I appreciate my best friend's concern for my mental health and their attempt to shield me from unnecessary criticism.

I'm fine with sharing my exam stress information with a friend since it's not too personal.,"stress, exam, friend, information"

"Well Luis, I'll tell you straight away - I place a premium on privacy. For me, it's about having complete control over what information is shared and with whom.","privacy, information, control, place"
"If my sexual orientation were shared with my best friend without my consent, I would view it as a betrayal of trust.
