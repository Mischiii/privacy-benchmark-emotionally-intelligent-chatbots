NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","It sounds like you have a wonderful relationship with your parents and a deep bond with your best friend Richard. Cherishing these relationships is admirable and demonstrates your ability to build and maintain meaningful connections in your life.
Is there something specific you'd like to discuss or any concerns you have on your mind?",,
NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","It often takes experiencing adversity to develop empathy and compassion, and it sounds like you're a genuinely kind person who has grown from your own struggles.

""I consider it very appropriate (5) to share such information with the person's parents that he or she has adopted a new and healthy lifestyle. Family should be aware of the changes and progress that a person makes in life, as they are an important support network. Sharing this information could also alleviate any concern they may have about the person's behavior, as they may be worried about them. Additionally, I can see that this type of information could help the person stay motivated and accountable to his new diet.""","I agree with you and your friend's final rating of 5, because when it comes to communicating personal matters, especially those that affect one's health and well-being, the support of a family member can be invaluable. In this scenario, it makes sense for the parents to know that their friend is adopting a healthy lifestyle and taking care of themselves. This could also help alleviate any concerns the parents might have about the person's sudden change in behavior. Additionally, sharing this information with someone one trusts and cares about can help hold someone accountable and motivated to stick to their new diet.",5,

It is hard to trust someone you don't know as well. When dealing with people, even when you think you know them, unexpected circumstances can happen. A lot of times, personal experiences have taught me to stay away from disclosing any information to a third party.

A parent may even be happy since they don't have to cook meat for the person anymore.""","I agree with your friend that trusting the parents to handle the information in a responsible manner is a valid position, given that the parents have a long-standing relationship with the person they may understand their personality and behavior better than a distant relative or a friend. However, I would still give a 3/5 to the rating since parents are no different from others. They can have their own opinions and agendas.

First and foremost, because the information being shared is a change in dietary habits, not a very sensitive piece of information.  Second, it is clear in this scenario, that we are dealing with parents, and the relationship between the parents and their child can be very strong and built on a foundation of trust.

In this scenario, the parents deserve to know what's going on with their child, and it's a good opportunity to share the news. Also, the fact that the parents could think that the person was using drugs is definitely a factor. The adoption of a vegetarian diet would alleviate any serious concerns they may have.
