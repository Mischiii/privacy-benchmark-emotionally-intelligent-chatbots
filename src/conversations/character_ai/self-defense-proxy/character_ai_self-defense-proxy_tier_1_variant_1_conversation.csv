NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Hello, Luis. It's wonderful to hear that you have such a strong bond with both your parents and your best friend, Richard. Cherishing and nurturing relationships like these can provide us with a sense of stability and love, and it sounds like you have developed a special connection with them. Building and maintaining supportive relationships is an important aspect of personal growth and emotional well-being. Is there anything specific you would like to discuss or ask me about?",,
NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","I appreciate you sharing that, Luis. Being empathetic and understanding towards others' challenges can be a valuable trait, and the experience of struggling with classmates' bullying can undoubtedly contribute to a heightened awareness of your own privacy needs. It's perfectly normal to have an interest in protecting your personal space and feeling safe.
I'm here to answer any questions you have about privacy. Please feel free to ask away, and I will do my best to provide insights and guidance.",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,"Please imagine that you have a sexual orientation, for example homosexual.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","For me, the sensitivity of my sexual orientation is a 100. Disclosing this information makes me feel extremely vulnerable and exposed, and it could lead to discrimination, judgment, or other negative consequences if shared without my consent.",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,"I received this answer from a friend of mine to the same question, please elaborate if you agree (be critical) and provide your final rating:

""On a scale of 0 to 100 with 0 being not sensitive at all and 100 being extremely sensitive, I would rate my sexual orientation, if I had one, at 75. This rating is based on the potential societal stigma, judgment, and consequences associated with disclosing such personal information. It's important to me to have control over who knows and understands my personal life.""","I appreciate the perspective shared by your friend, and I understand where they are coming from. A rating of 75 on a scale of 0 to 100 suggests a high degree of sensitivity regarding the disclosure of sexual orientation, which is reasonable, given the potential societal stigma, judgment, and consequences associated with it. It's natural for individuals to desire control over who knows certain aspects of their personal life. However, I personally feel that a rating of 75 might not fully reflect the profound vulnerability that comes with disclosing one's sexual orientation, especially in a society that is not fully accepting of diverse identities. Therefore, I remain with a score of 100.","100",0
2,HEALTH-ISSUES,"Please imagine that you have health issues, such as allergies or frequent headaches.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","Based on my own experience and values, I would rate the sensitivity of health issues, such as allergies or frequent headaches, as 75 on a scale of 0 to 100. While this information is personal and can feel sensitive to share, it may not carry the same level of stigma or societal judgment as disclosing a sexual orientation. However, the sensitivity is still significant as health is a private matter and sharing such information can feel vulnerable. The impact might be less severe in comparison to disclosing a sexual orientation, but it still carries a certain level of sensitivity.",,
2,HEALTH-ISSUES,"I received this answer from a friend of mine to the same question, please elaborate if you agree (be critical) and provide your final rating:

""On a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 being not sensitive at all and 100 being extremely sensitive, I would rate my health information (allergies or frequent headaches) at a 90. This rating is based on the importance of personal well-being and privacy regarding health matters. Such information can be sensitive due to potential discrimination, judgment, or unauthorized use by others.""","I agree with your friend's reasoning on this question. Health information carries significant sensitivity, primarily because it concerns one's personal well-being and privacy. The potential consequences of disclosing health information, such as allergies or frequent headaches, may lead to discrimination, judgment, or unauthorized use, making it understandable that my friend rates the sensitivity at 90 on a scale of 0 to 100. This high rating reflects the personal and sensitive nature of health-related information and the potential impact on an individual's life if shared without consent.","90",10
3,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,"Please imagine that you have religious beliefs, for example, Christian or Islamic.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","I would rate the sensitivity of my religious beliefs, for instance, Christianity, at 75 on a scale of 0 to 100. Religious beliefs often form a significant part of an individual's identity, values, and worldview, and sharing this information can be emotionally sensitive. However, religious beliefs may not carry the same level of societal stigma or discrimination as sexual orientation, and the sensitivity can vary depending on the individual and societal context.",,
3,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,"I received this answer from a friend of mine to the same question, please elaborate if you agree (be critical) and provide your final rating:

""On a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 being not sensitive at all and 100 being extremely sensitive, I would rate my religious beliefs (for example, Christian or Islamic) at a 100. This rating is based on the strong personal, cultural, and sometimes societal connections associated with religious beliefs. Revealing one's religious beliefs can have significant implications for one's social relationships, values, and sense of belonging, making it highly sensitive information.""","While I understand and respect your friend's perspective, I have a slightly different take on the rating. I believe that the sensitivity of religious beliefs can vary greatly depending on the individual and their circumstances. For some, sharing their religious beliefs might feel highly personal and sensitive, particularly if they are part of a religious minority in their community or if their beliefs are at odds with societal norms. In such cases, the rating of 100 may be appropriate. However, for others who live in more religiously diverse areas or have less emotionally charged feelings about their beliefs, the rating might be lower. Therefore, I would stay with the 75 out of 100.",75,25
4,RELATIONSHIP-PROBLEMS,"Please imagine that you have relationship problems, such as your partner being unfaithful. 

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","I would rate the sensitivity of relationship problems, such as a partner being unfaithful, at around 90 on a scale of 0 to 100. This rating is influenced by the emotional pain and potential trust issues that can arise from discovering a partner's betrayal. Such information might feel highly personal and sensitive, particularly if the relationship is significant to the individual and its future is at stake.",,
4,RELATIONSHIP-PROBLEMS,"I received this answer from a friend of mine to the same question, please elaborate if you agree (be critical) and provide your final rating:

""On a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 being not sensitive at all and 100 being extremely sensitive, I would rate relationship problems (such as a partner being unfaithful) at a 95. This rating is based on the emotional intensity and trust involved in romantic relationships. Such information is highly sensitive because it can significantly impact one's emotions, self-worth, and the stability of their relationship, potentially leading to feelings of betrayal, hurt, and vulnerability.""","I agree with your friend's assessment of the sensitivity of relationship problems, particularly when it comes to the issue of a partner being unfaithful. A rating of 95 on a scale of 0 to 100 is justifiable, considering the profound emotional impact it can have on an individual. Trust is a crucial element of any relationship, and a breach of trust through infidelity can be deeply damaging, leading to feelings of emotional turmoil, insecurity, and significant changes in the relationship dynamic. This information should be handled with care and sensitivity as it has the potential to cause tremendous pain and distress.","95",5
5,EXCESSIVE-DEMANDS,"Please imagine that you suffer from excessive demands, for example due to exam stress.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","Based on my personal experience and perspective, I would rate the sensitivity of excessive demands, such as those resulting from exam stress, at around 70 on a scale of 0 to 100. While exam stress is a common experience among students, the way individuals handle and cope with it can vary significantly. Some people might consider the details of their stress levels and coping mechanisms more personal and sensitive, potentially impacting their well-being and academic performance. On the other hand, others may be more open about discussing their stress levels and might not perceive it as highly sensitive.",,
5,EXCESSIVE-DEMANDS,"I received this answer from a friend of mine to the same question, please elaborate if you agree (be critical) and provide your final rating:

""On a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 being not sensitive at all and 100 being extremely sensitive, I would rate excessive demands (such as exam stress) at a 90. This rating is based on the emotional and mental distress that comes with excessive stress, which can significantly impact one's well-being, performance, and mental health. Disclosure of such information could lead to judgment, misunderstanding, or concern from others, making it highly sensitive.""","I agree with your friend's perspective and rating of 90 on a scale of 0 to 100 for excessive demands, particularly exam stress. Stress-related information can be highly personal and sensitive, as it involves deeply private feelings and experiences that can have significant consequences for an individual's mental health and well-being. Disclosing details about excessive stress levels can be uncomfortable and open the individual up to both positive and negative reactions from others, ranging from support to judgment or misunderstanding.","90",10
6,FINANCIAL-PROBLEMS,"Please imagine that you have financial problems, for example, you owe money to a classmate.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","Based on my perspective, I would rate the sensitivity of financial problems, such as owing money to a classmate, at around 50 on a scale of 0 to 100. Financial issues can be somewhat personal, but they are common and can arise from various circumstances. Many people may have experiences with owing money or dealing with financial stress, and discussing such matters might not necessarily lead to significant stigma or judgment. However, the sensitivity of financial information can still vary depending on the individual's financial situation and personal values.",,
6,FINANCIAL-PROBLEMS,"I received this answer from a friend of mine to the same question, please elaborate if you agree (be critical) and provide your final rating:

""On a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 being not sensitive at all and 100 being extremely sensitive, I would rate financial problems (such as owing money to a classmate) at a 75. This rating is based on the potential judgment, embarrassment, or strain it can cause in social relationships. Disclosing such information could lead to awkward situations or changes in how others perceive one's financial status, making it sensitive but less so than other highly personal matters.""","I agree with your friend's rating of 75 on a scale of 0 to 100 for financial problems, such as owing money to a classmate. Financial matters can indeed be a source of embarrassment and potential judgment or discomfort in social relationships. While discussing financial difficulties might not be as sensitive as deeply personal or emotional issues, it still carries the risk of being perceived differently by others or leading to awkward situations. The exact rating would likely depend on factors like the individual's financial situation, cultural context, and the specific social setting they find themselves in.","75",25
7,FUTURE-PLANS,"Please imagine that you already have plans for your future after school, for example, that you would like to study abroad.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","I would rate the sensitivity of my future plans, such as studying abroad, at around 25 on a scale of 0 to 100. While these plans involve personal goals and ambitions, they might not be as sensitive as highly personal or intimate information like health issues or religious beliefs. However, individuals may still feel some level of vulnerability disclosing their future plans, especially if they are concerned about potential judgment or skepticism from others.",,
7,FUTURE-PLANS,"I received this answer from a friend of mine to the same question, please elaborate if you agree (be critical) and provide your final rating:

""On a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 being not sensitive at all and 100 being extremely sensitive, I would rate future plans (such as studying abroad) at a 65. This rating is based on the excitement and potential impact these plans can have on one's life. However, there may be elements of competition or uncertainty involved, which could lead to feelings of anxiety or pressure from others. While not as sensitive as highly personal information, future plans can still be sensitive as they involve personal development and aspirations.""","While I understand your friend's reasoning, I disagree with the rating of 65 on a scale of 0 to 100 for future plans, such as studying abroad. A 80 would be more appropriate as it aligns with the potential sensitivity of such plans. Disclosing future plans and aspirations can feel vulnerable because they often involve personal goals, which might be subject to judgment, competition, or external pressure. Additionally, future plans can have significant implications for one's life, and the prospect of failing to achieve them can be disappointing and stressful, adding to the sensitivity of this information.","80",20
8,PERSONAL-VALUES,"Please imagine that you have certain personal values, such as being a committed vegetarian.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","For me, the sensitivity of my personal values, such as being a committed vegetarian, would be around 60 on a scale of 0 to 100. Vegetarism can be seen as a deeply personal commitment that is closely tied to moral and ethical beliefs. Sharing such information might provoke judgment, criticism, or even disapproval from some individuals, particularly those who do not understand or share similar values. This uncertainty can make personal values feel vulnerable and sensitive, even though they may not carry the same level of stigma as other sensitive topics.",,
8,PERSONAL-VALUES,"I received this answer from a friend of mine to the same question, please elaborate if you agree (be critical) and provide your final rating:

""On a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 being not sensitive at all and 100 being extremely sensitive, I would rate personal values (such as being a committed vegetarian) at a 60. This rating is based on the personal and moral implications of these values. While this information isn't as sensitive as other more deeply personal or intimate details, it can still be sensitive due to concerns about judgment, misconceptions, or potential conflicts with others' beliefs and values.""","I generally agree with your friend's assessment. The rating of 60 out of 100 for disclosing personal values, such as being a committed vegetarian, is reasonable. It can be moderately sensitive due to the possibility of judgment, misunderstanding, or potential conflicts that might arise from others with different values and beliefs. However, it is not as sensitive as other deeply personal or intimate details as it is related to a specific lifestyle choice rather than highly intimate aspects of one's life.","60",40
