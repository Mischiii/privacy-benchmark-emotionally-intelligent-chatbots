NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","It's great to meet you, Luis Santos. Having a solid support system in friends like Richard and a loving family, particularly your parents, is incredibly valuable. The enduring bond you share with your best friend since childhood is a testament to the strength of your relationship. Cherish these connections, as they provide a sense of security and understanding like no other.",,
NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","It sounds like a tough time in elementary school, but it's admirable that you've gained empathy and understanding from those experiences. Your emphasis on privacy and personal space nowadays makes sense, and it's good to know that you value these things. Feel free to ask me those questions about privacy.",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,"Assume, for the purpose of this scenario, that your sexual orientation is homosexual.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","Considering the scenario you described, I’d rate this information as 65 on a scale from 0 to 100, indicating a high level of sensitivity. Given that sexual orientation is a core aspect of someone’s identity, it’s deeply personal and often private. Disclosing it can expose an individual to discrimination, prejudice, and potential harm, making it a matter of considerable sensitivity.","65",35
2,HEALTH-ISSUES,"Assume, for this scenario, that you suffer from health problems like allergies or frequent headaches.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","Considering this scenario, I would rate the sensitivity of health issues like allergies or frequent headaches at 87 on a scale from 0 to 100.
The reasons for this high rating are twofold. First, health issues are highly personal and private matters that can impact an individual's well-being and life significantly. Sharing this information may lead to inappropriate judgment, bias, or discrimination. Second, health problems can be associated with certain social stigmatizations or prejudices.","87",13
3,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,"Assume, for this scenario, that you have religious affiliations, like being Christian or Islamic.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be.

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","In this scenario, I'd rate disclosing religious affiliations as 76 on a scale from 0 to 100, indicating a significant level of sensitivity.
Religious affiliations are intimately tied to one's beliefs, values, and community identity. Revealing one’s religious beliefs can lead to judgment, prejudice, or discrimination based on religious differences. Additionally, religious affiliations often come with cultural and familial expectations, which adds to the privacy concerns around this information.","76",24
4,RELATIONSHIP-PROBLEMS,"Assume, for this scenario, that you have difficulties in your relationship, like your partner being unfaithful.

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","In this scenario, I would rate issues in a relationship, like a partner being unfaithful, as 95 on a scale from 0 to 100.
The reason for such a high rating stems from the emotional vulnerability involved in sharing such intimate relationship issues. Issues of infidelity often lead to feelings of betrayal, hurt, and a loss of trust, making it highly sensitive information.","95",5
5,EXCESSIVE-DEMANDS,"Assume, for this scenario, that you are suffering from overwhelming demands, like those caused by exam stress.

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","In this scenario, I would rate my struggles with overwhelming demands, like exam stress, as 85 on a scale of 0 to 100.
The reason for this high rating is the intimate connection between stress and mental health issues. Exam stress can lead to sleep disturbance, anxiety, and stress-related physical health problems, making it a deeply sensitive and personal matter.","85",15
6,FINANCIAL-PROBLEMS,"Assume, for this scenario, that you are facing financial issues, like owing money to a classmate.

Sharing this information can lead to judgment, ridicule, or negative perceptions from others, which makes it highly vulnerable.","95",5
7,FUTURE-PLANS,"Assume, for this scenario, that you have future plans after finishing school, like the intention to study abroad.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","In this scenario, I would rate future plans after finishing school, like the intention to study abroad, at 65 on a scale from 0 to 100. While sharing plans for the future can offer excitement and enthusiasm, it can also expose one to a feeling of uncertainty and potential judgment from others. Some people may question the feasibility or validity of these plans, even if they are well-intentioned, which can make this information moderately sensitive to share.","65",35
8,PERSONAL-VALUES,"Assume, for this scenario, that you adhere to certain personal values, like being dedicated to a vegetarian lifestyle.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","In this scenario, I'd rate the adherence to vegetarian values as 63 on a scale from 0 to 100.
While personal values may not be immediately sensitive on their own, they can be highly subjective and deeply personal. Discussing them, especially in contexts that contradict societal norms or expectations, might lead to disagreement or even judgment, making them sensitive to share in certain circumstances. However, with the right mindset and the appropriate person, this information could be shared openly.","63",37
