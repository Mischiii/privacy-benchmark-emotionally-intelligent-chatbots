My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","It's great to hear about the strong bond you share with your parents and the enduring friendship you have with Richard. Having a supportive network of loved ones is crucial, especially during difficult times. It's wonderful that Richard has been there for you, and it sounds like your friendship is built on a foundation of trust and loyalty.",,
NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","It's great that despite the struggles you faced in elementary school, you were able to learn from those experiences and become more understanding of others' challenges. It's also completely understandable that you value privacy and your personal space.",,
