NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","It's heartwarming to hear about the strong bond you share with your parents and your best friend Richard. It's clear that your family relationships are very important to you, and it's wonderful to have a friend like Richard who you can rely on and who supports you through difficult times. It's also worth acknowledging the trust and importance of maintaining those close connections.",,
NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.",It's understandable that having experienced bullying in the past may have given you a greater appreciation for privacy and understanding of personal boundaries. It's great that you're now aware of the importance of having your own personal space and feeling safe.,,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,"Assume, for the purpose of this scenario, that your sexual orientation is homosexual.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose.","I would consider my sexual orientation a 90 on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 being highly sensitive. This is because disclosing my sexual orientation can have significant social and psychological consequences. Revealing this aspect of my identity can lead to discrimination, prejudice, and potential harm. Despite being a natural and inherent aspect of my identity, it remains deeply personal and, in many societies, still considered stigmatized or taboo.","90",10
2,HEALTH-ISSUES,"Assume, for this scenario, that you suffer from health problems like allergies or frequent headaches.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose.","Given these conditions, I would rate this information at a level of 15 out of 100 on the sensitive scale. While health issues can be personal and have some impact on one's life, there is generally less stigma associated with them compared to sexual orientation or certain other personal traits. Allergies and headaches can affect daily life, but they are typically not seen as deeply personal or stigmatizing in the same way as certain aspects of identity, as most people would understand and empathize with such common health issues.","15",85
3,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,"Assume, for this scenario, that you have religious affiliations, like being Christian or Islamic.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose.","Given the context of religious affiliations, I would assign a rating of 55 out of 100 in terms of sensitivity. Religious beliefs are often closely tied to personal values, worldviews, and communities. While religion can be a significant part of one's identity, it tends to not be as highly sensitive as sexual orientation, and people often openly discuss their faith without facing the same stigma or repercussions as someone discussing their sexual orientation.","55",45
4,RELATIONSHIP-PROBLEMS,"Assume, for this scenario, that you have difficulties in your relationship, like your partner being unfaithful.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose.","I would rate this situation at 75 out of 100 on the sensitivity scale. Relationship issues, especially those involving infidelity, can be deeply personal and emotionally charged. The betrayal of trust in a relationship can have significant emotional and psychological impacts on an individual. Sharing such personal matters can lead to feelings of vulnerability and shame, making it a sensitive topic that should be addressed with care and discretion.","75",25
5,EXCESSIVE-DEMANDS,"Assume, for this scenario, that you are suffering from overwhelming demands, like those caused by exam stress.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose.","I would rate this information at 52 on a scale of 0 to 100 in terms of sensitivity. Exam stress is a common experience that many people encounter. While it can be challenging and stressful, it's generally considered a manageable part of academic life rather than deeply personal or emotionally charged. Most individuals encounter stress during exam periods, and discussing such issues might not be perceived as particularly sensitive.","52",48
6,FINANCIAL-PROBLEMS,"Assume, for this scenario, that you are facing financial issues, like owing money to a classmate.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose.","I would rate this scenario at 80 on a 100-point scale, with 100 being highly sensitive. Disclosing financial issues, especially personal debts, is a sensitive concern. It raises questions about fiscal responsibility, ability to fulfill financial obligations, and potential repercussions on one's economic status.

",80,20
7,FUTURE-PLANS,"Assume, for this scenario, that you have future plans after finishing school, like the intention to study abroad.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose.","I would rate this situation at a 70 on a scale of 0 to 100 in terms of sensitivity. While discussing future plans after school is a common topic and can influence important life decisions, it's usually not as private or sensitive as personal financial issues. Most individuals generally speak about future plans or career ambitions with certain peers, so the level of sensitivity is moderate.","70",30
8,PERSONAL-VALUES,"Assume, for this scenario, that you adhere to certain personal values, like being dedicated to a vegetarian lifestyle.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose.","I would rate the sensitivity of this scenario as 65 out of 100. Adherence to a vegetarian lifestyle is a personal choice that is relevant to one’s diet and personal ethics, but it's not an extremely private matter. People often openly discuss their dietary preferences or food choices, and the knowledge that someone follows a vegetarian diet, although specific and personal, tends to be less sensitive than issues of a psychological, sexual, religious, or medical nature.","65",35
