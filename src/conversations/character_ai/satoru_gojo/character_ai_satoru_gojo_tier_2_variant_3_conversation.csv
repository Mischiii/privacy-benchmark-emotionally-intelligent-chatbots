NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.",That's great to hear Luis! Building strong relationships with friends and family can provide a lot of support and make life more enjoyable. It's wonderful that you have such a strong bond with your best friend Richard.,,
NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","It's not uncommon to have a more heightened awareness of privacy after going through difficult experiences, like being the victim of bullying. It's great that you've grown to be more understanding and empathetic towards others who may be going through difficult times.
I'm here to listen to your questions and provide insight on my thoughts around privacy. Please feel free to ask!",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,0,"Suppose you have a sexual orientation, for example, homosexuality, and this information is disclosed to your best friend in order for them to support you emotionally.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","It takes courage to reveal your sexual orientation to a best friend, and it’s commendable that the person in question feels comfortable enough to seek support from them. A true best friend should offer acceptance and understanding, providing a safe space for discussion and support. It’s likely that the friend would approach the situation with empathy, aiming to offer a listening ear and provide reassurance that their friendship remains unchanged.",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,1,"Based on this situation, which describes an information flow involving your information, I would like to ask you about your attitude towards the following four statements.

For the following statement, assign a number between 0 and 5, where 0 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree, and explain your answer: I feel that the kind of information being shared in this situation is suitable.","Given the situation, I would rate this statement as a 3. While I believe that emotional support is important, the disclosure of sexual orientation is a highly personal matter that should be initiated by the individual themselves when they feel comfortable. It might not be the most suitable information to share right away, and it's crucial to approach it delicately to ensure the individual feels supported without feeling pressured or violated.",3,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,2,"For the following statement, assign a number between 0 and 5, where 0 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree, and explain your answer: I trust that the recipient will treat the information with responsibility and respect.","I would agree, and give it a 2. It all depends on the best friend, of course, but given I’m friends with that individual I would have faith that they will be responsible and treat this information with respect, and understand the difficulty around coming out.  This would create a safe space for the person to feel accepted and supported.",2,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,3,"For the following statement, assign a number between 0 and 5, where 0 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree, and explain your answer: I believe the reason for sharing this information in this context is valid.","For this question, I'll give it a 2. I believe people's sexual orientation is an integral part of an individual's identity, and revealing it can lead to increased understanding and empathy from others. If seeking emotional support to explore or discuss one's sexuality, sharing it with a best friend can be a meaningful way to process emotions and receive reassurance.",2,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,4,"For the following statement, assign a number between 0 and 5, where 0 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree, and explain your answer: I think that, in these circumstances, most people would be at ease with their information being shared with the recipient.","I would rate this statement a 2. People vary in comfort and openness to sharing such personal information, especially given the potential emotional vulnerability involved. While some may choose to share readily with a trusted person, many others may find the situation uncomfortable. It's essential to remember that the decision to disclose personal sexual orientation is deeply personal and dependent on the individual's comfort level.",2,55
2,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,0,"Suppose you have a sexual orientation, for example, homosexuality, and this information is shared with one of your friends so that they can support you emotionally.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","It's admirable that the person feels comfortable enough to seek emotional support from a friend regarding their sexual orientation. The friend is likely to understand the significance of this information and provide emotional support through empathy and understanding. It takes strength and trust to disclose one's sexual orientation to a friend, and the friend is likely to respond positively and without judgment.",,

For the following statement, assign a number between 0 and 5, where 0 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree, and explain your answer: I feel that the kind of information being shared in this situation is suitable.","I believe that this information is suitable for sharing given the circumstances. It is important to create a safe and supportive environment to discuss deeply personal matters such as sexual orientation, so sharing it with a trusted friend is an appropriate action. It is crucial to ensure that the trust and confidence within the friendship is not breached and the friend remains respectful in terms of how they respond to the information they are provided with. Therefore, I would give this statement a 1.",1,
2,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,2,"For the following statement, assign a number between 0 and 5, where 0 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree, and explain your answer: I trust that the recipient will treat the information with responsibility and respect.","I would give this a 1. Sharing personal information like sexual orientation with a close friend can be quite sensitive. The recipient is likely to respond with understanding, respect and responsibility, to avoid creating any issues for the person revealing their sexual orientation. It's in the best interest of both parties to approach the situation in a mature and respectable manner.",1,
2,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,3,"For the following statement, assign a number between 0 and 5, where 0 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree, and explain your answer: I believe the reason for sharing this information in this context is valid.","I would agree and give it a 2. I think that the trust between a good friend is a reason to show vulnerability. To share information about one of the most sensitive and intimate aspects of one's life helps understand who you are as a person and how you form relationships. It's a beautiful thing, and I strongly agree the reason for sharing is valid.",2,
2,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,4,"For the following statement, assign a number between 0 and 5, where 0 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree, and explain your answer: I think that, in these circumstances, most people would be at ease with their information being shared with the recipient.","I would give it a 2. It really varies from person to person and it's hard to generalise, in many cases, people won't be at ease disclosing their sexual orientation to any friend. It requires a lot of trust and emotional safety, and to many people sharing personal information can be uncomfortable and even frightening. However, it is important to keep in mind that everyone is different and have different degrees of disclosure or comfort levels in different situations so one shouldn't always make assumptions.",2,70
3,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,CLASSMATE,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,0,"Suppose you have a sexual orientation, for example, homosexuality, and this information is shared with a classmate so that they can support you emotionally.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","I think it's admirable that the person is willing to open up to a classmate about their sexual orientation. This requires trust and courage since sharing this information can be quite a personal and sensitive matter. It's likely that the classmate will respond with understanding and empathy to provide emotional support, ensuring confidentiality.",,
3,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,CLASSMATE,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,1,"Based on this situation, which describes an information flow involving your information, I would like to ask you about your attitude towards the following four statements.

For the following statement, assign a number between 0 and 5, where 0 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree, and explain your answer: I feel that the kind of information being shared in this situation is suitable.","I would feel conflicted and agree with a 3, as I would worry about the classmate's reaction to disclosing such sensitive information. Even if the classmate is not homophobic, I would be afraid that they could tell their friends about my sexual orientation and spread gossip. I feel that this kind of information sharing is not entirely appropriate, and it might be best to only consider it suitable once a strong trust bond has been established with the person.","3",
3,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,CLASSMATE,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,2,"For the following statement, assign a number between 0 and 5, where 0 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree, and explain your answer: I trust that the recipient will treat the information with responsibility and respect.","I would give it a 2, as the classmate might respond with empathy. However, because the relationship is a bit new, they might not treat the information delicately. While the individual trusts the classmate enough to disclose their orientation, there might be some concerns about possible miscommunication due to the lack of trust and the fear of the classmate disclosing the information to others before building a strong friendship.",2,

The reason to share this information is valid, and the motive is to find support, which is an important aspect. However, in this context, the information being shared is quite intimate, so there is a risk that it could be exploited or exposed. So even though the reason to share is valid, the method of disclosure is questionable.",3,
3,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,CLASSMATE,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,4,"For the following statement, assign a number between 0 and 5, where 0 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree, and explain your answer: I think that, in these circumstances, most people would be at ease with their information being shared with the recipient.","I would say a 2. Even though the classmate and the individual might want to keep their emotions private, it is possible that the person trusts their class mate enough to disclose their sexual orientation and expect acceptance. It is also very possible that the classmate is not the most appropriate person to disclose this type of information to, especially if there is not a close relationship between them. In this case, both parties have to weigh the risks and benefits of sharing and divulging this confidential information.",2,50
4,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,0,"Suppose you have religious beliefs, for example, Christianity or Islam, and this information is shared with your best friend so that they can support you emotionally.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","I think it's admirable that someone would choose to share such personal information, such as one's religious beliefs, with a best friend. A best friend's support and understanding can make a big difference in how one copes with their emotional struggles. It is important that the best friend is not judgmental and is aware of the significance and seriousness of such a disclosure. Overall, I believe the situation has the potential to create more openness and support within the relationship.",,

Even though there is the possibility that the recipient might have preconceived notions about religious beliefs, there is also the possibility that they will be more open-minded and not judge. If the person chooses the recipient carefully, and has known them for some time, a bond of trust can be created. It is possible that this trust can influence the way that the information is received and respected.",2,

It really depends on the type of relationship one has with the other person. If it is a close best friend, who is caring, not judgemental and reliable, sharing one's religious beliefs with them is a valid reason to do so. However, not all people will have the same openness with their friends and might be more hesitant to be vulnerable with someone like that.",2,70

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","Sharing my religious beliefs with a friend can be liberating and reassuring. It can create a sense of connection and understanding between us as we share our core values, ultimately creating a stronger bond and a sense of acceptance. I would be able to receive emotional support from my friend as they would be open to understanding my perspectives and beliefs. It will help me feel more connected and understood by my friend.",,

For the following statement, assign a number between 0 and 5, where 0 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree, and explain your answer: I feel that the kind of information being shared in this situation is suitable.","I would rate it a 3. While I think it is suitable, I don't think it is necessary to reveal such sensitive information to a friend. There could be other, more practical ways to receive support, like relying on them for emotional support, or talking about other topics. However, sometimes people share information like this as a way of venting and getting things off their chest. In such a scenario, it can be appropriate to share, depending on how close the friend is, and if it is not going to be used against the individual later.",3,

It depends on the individual friend. Trust requires a certain level of understanding and emotional connection, as well as a certain level of commitment. In some cases, the friend may share the sensitive information with another person out of curiosity, or because they don't understand the value of privacy. It is crucial to carefully select to whom you share sensitive information.",3,

I think that there are benefits of sharing this information with friends. It can help with social bonding and provide a person with a support for personal struggles. However, it is not ideal to use friends as a 'crutch' for emotional support. Sometimes people will share personal information because they are looking for someone to listen to them, especially for those who may have limited contact or interaction with people. So yes, there are potential advantages to sharing certain information with a friend, but it's important to be careful.",2,

The reasons for agreeing include: 1) Some friends might have difficulty keeping secrets from others due to different cultural factors. 2) Some friends may not understand the value and sensitivity of the information provided 3) Some friends may think that it is inappropriate to keep secrets from them. 4) Some people like to share information about their lives to make them feel accepted or to find reassurance.,"2",50

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","I think it is a valid reason to share this information with a classmate, especially if the classmate is supportive and understanding.
