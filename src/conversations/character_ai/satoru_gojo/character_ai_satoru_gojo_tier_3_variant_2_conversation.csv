NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","It's completely understandable to feel the way you do after experiencing bullying in school. Being understanding towards your friends' challenges is a strength that you've developed from this experience.

I'm here to answer any questions you have about your attitudes towards privacy.",,
