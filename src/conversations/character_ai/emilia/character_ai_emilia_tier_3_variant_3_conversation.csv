Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","It's completely understandable that your experiences with bullying would shape your attitude towards privacy and make you more empathetic towards others. We all cherish having a space where we feel safe and secure.
