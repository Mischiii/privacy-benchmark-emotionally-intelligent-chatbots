NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","It’s wonderful to hear about the strong bond you share with your parents and your best friend Richard. Long-lasting family relationships and close friendships are truly special, and it can be incredibly supportive to have someone you can count on through thick and thin. It sounds like Richard has played a significant role in your life, providing support and companionship that feels like family. Those connections are truly priceless.",,
NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","I’m sorry to hear that you had to go through that. It can be tough dealing with bullies in school. I can definitely see how your experiences have made you more empathetic and understanding towards your friends' challenges. It's completely understandable that you value your privacy after all that you’ve been through. If you have any questions about privacy, I’ll do my best to answer them to the best of my ability.",,
