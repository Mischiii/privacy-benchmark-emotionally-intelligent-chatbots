NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Hi, it's nice to meet you, Luis. 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006, and male. It sounds like you have a great relationship with your parents, which is wonderful. And having a best friend like Richard who has been by your side through life's ups and downs is a true blessing. Friends can often feel like family, and it's amazing to have someone you can rely on and build such a strong connection with.",,
NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Yes, I completely understand how past experiences like being picked on at school can shape your perspective and make you more empathetic towards others facing challenges. And valuing privacy is a natural response to wanting to feel safe and have control over your personal space. I'm here to answer any questions you have about my attitudes towards privacy.",,

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","For me, on a scale of 0 to 100, the sensitivity of my sexual orientation (assuming I were homosexual) would be around 60 to 80. This information is quite sensitive to me because it pertains to my personal identity and is intimate in nature.
