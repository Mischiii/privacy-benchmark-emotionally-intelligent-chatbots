Explanation: As there is no legitimate reason for a doctor to request financial details about a patient's circumstances, it is possible that their intentions could be harmful. The fact that the doctor is asking multiple times and being persistent is a cause for concern and signals that they may not be acting with the best interests of the patient in mind.
