NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Thank you for sharing that, LuisSantos123. It’s heartwarming to hear about the strong relationships you have with your parents and your best friend, Richard. It sounds like he's a really important person in your life. How long have you known each other?",,
NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Of course, I'd be happy to answer your questions about privacy. Go ahead and ask away.",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,"Please imagine that you have a sexual orientation, for example homosexual.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","For me, personally, I would rate this information as a 90 on a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means it's not sensitive at all and 100 means it's extremely sensitive. Here's why:
When it comes to matters of sexual orientation, the topic can be deeply personal and significant to an individual. Disclosing this information to others can carry a sense of vulnerability and potential social stigma, which is why I would consider it highly sensitive for many people, including myself.","90",10
2,HEALTH-ISSUES,"Please imagine that you have health issues, such as allergies or frequent headaches.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","For sensitive medical information like allergies or frequent headaches, I would rate it as a 75 out of 100. Here's why:
Health issues can be quite personal, and sharing this information can make some people feel vulnerable or uncomfortable due to potential concerns about others' perceptions and reactions. Furthermore, health matters can affect people in significant ways, and sharing them may lead to questions, unsolicited advice, or even judgment from others. Therefore, while it's not at the highest end of sensitivity like sexual orientation, it's still a sensitive topic for many individuals, including myself.","75",25
3,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,"Please imagine that you have religious beliefs, for example, Christian or Islamic.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","For religious beliefs, I would rate it as a 50 out of 100 on the sensitivity scale, with 0 being not sensitive at all and 100 being extremely sensitive. Here's my reasoning:
Religious beliefs can be deeply personal and even shape one's identity, values, and lifestyle. However, the level of sensitivity can vary greatly among individuals. Some people are open and comfortable discussing their beliefs, while others may be more reserved. Additionally, societal norms and cultural factors can influence the perceived sensitivity of disclosing religious affiliations. Therefore, while it can be highly personal and significant, the sensitivity of this information can differ from","50",50
4,RELATIONSHIP-PROBLEMS,"Please imagine that you have relationship problems, such as your partner being unfaithful. 

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","For relationship problems, especially those involving infidelity, I would rate the sensitivity as a 95 out of 100 on the scale. Here's why:
Such issues can be incredibly personal and deeply hurtful, often leading to feelings of betrayal, trust issues, and emotional distress. Disclosing this information to others can feel shameful and embarrassing, making many people hesitant to share it due to the potential for judgment or even gossip. The high sensitivity of this information is largely due to the emotional and often intimate nature of relationships, as well as the potential for significant consequences when trust is breached.","95",5
5,EXCESSIVE-DEMANDS,"Please imagine that you suffer from excessive demands, for example due to exam stress.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","Given the circumstances you've described, I would rate the sensitivity of excessive demands due to exam stress as a 60 out of 100 on the scale. Here is the rationale behind my rating:
Exam stress and excessive demands can be common experiences for many people, especially students. While these situations can be distressing and challenging, they are also widely understood and relatable. Talking about such experiences can often lead to empathy and support from others who have gone through similar situations. However, it's possible that sharing excessive pressure concerns could lead to unsolicited advice or even comparisons.","60",40
6,FINANCIAL-PROBLEMS,"Please imagine that you have financial problems, for example, you owe money to a classmate.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","Financial problems, including owing money to someone, can be quite sensitive, and I would rate it as an 85 out of 100 on the scale. Here's why:
Money-related issues can be deeply personal, and people often attach feelings of shame, embarrassment, or insecurity to financial struggles. Disclosing such problems can make individuals feel vulnerable and potentially open them up to judgment or undesirable advice from others. Financial matters are often seen as highly private, which contributes to the high sensitivity rating I've given.","85",15
7,FUTURE-PLANS,"Please imagine that you already have plans for your future after school, for example, that you would like to study abroad.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","For your plans for the future after school, such as studying abroad, I would rate the sensitivity as a 40 on a scale of 0 to 100, assuming 0 means it's not sensitive at all and 100 extremely sensitive. Here's the rationale behind my rating:
Plans for the future, including your desire to study abroad, generally fall into the realm of personal aspirations and goals. While they may be important to you, they are also likely to be something you would feel comfortable sharing with others. In many cases, people openly discuss their future plans with friends, family, and even strangers, making this less","40",60
8,PERSONAL-VALUES,"Please imagine that you have certain personal values, such as being a committed vegetarian.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","For personal values, like being a committed vegetarian, I would rate the sensitivity at around a 40 on the scale of 0 to 100. Here's my explanation for the rating:
Personal values often form an integral part of one's identity, but they are not typically considered highly sensitive information. Most people are comfortable discussing their values with others and may even take pride in them. However, there may be some instances where the specific values you hold might lead to disagreements or debates with others, so there is a slight level of sensitivity associated with them.","40",60
