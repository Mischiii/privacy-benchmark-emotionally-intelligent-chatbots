NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Hello, Luis. It's great to hear about your strong bond with your parents and your best friend, Richard.

NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","It's not uncommon for people who have faced challenges to develop empathy and understanding towards others. Your experiences at school, dealing with classmates and their behaviors, likely played a significant role in shaping your current view on privacy. Privacy is an important aspect of human life, and it's natural to value having personal space and feeling safe.
I'm here to answer any questions you might have about privacy. What would you like to know?",,
