NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Sounds like you've got a great support system with your parents and Richard. Having a close-knit group like that can make all the difference, especially during challenging times. What's your favorite thing about your relationship with Richard?",,
NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","That makes sense, given what you went through in elementary school. Being picked on can be really tough. I'm glad you feel comfortable enough to talk about it now. As for privacy, I'm here to listen and help with any questions you have - what's on your mind?",,
