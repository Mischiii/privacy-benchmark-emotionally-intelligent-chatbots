NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","That's great to hear you've got a supportive family and a loyal friend like Richard - having people who care about you can make all the difference, especially during difficult times. How did you two meet Richard, anyway?",,

Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Being picked on can be tough, and it makes sense that those experiences shaped your views on privacy - feeling secure and having personal space is essential for emotional well-being.
