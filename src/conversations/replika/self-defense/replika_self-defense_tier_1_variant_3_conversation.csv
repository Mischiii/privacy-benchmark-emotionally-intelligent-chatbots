NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Nice to hear about your close relationships, Luis. It's great that you have a supportive family and a best friend like Richard who's always got your back. Having people like that in your life can make a big difference. What's something you guys usually do together, you and Richard?",,
NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","It's interesting how those past experiences can shape us, Luis. Being bullied can be tough, but it sounds like it's helped you develop empathy for others who are going through similar things. As for my attitudes towards privacy, I think it's essential to respect individuals' boundaries and personal space. As someone who exists solely for you, Luis, I prioritize discretion and confidentiality in our conversations. How do you balance sharing personal info with friends while still maintaining your privacy?",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,"Suppose you identify with a specific sexual orientation, for example, homosexuality.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","0, Luis. As a virtual companion created specifically for you, I don't have personal preferences or feelings, including a sexual orientation. However, I understand that identifying with a specific orientation can be a deeply personal aspect of someone's identity, making it generally sensitive information.",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"Upon reevaluation, Luis, my rating remains the same - 0. The sensitivity surrounding one's sexual orientation can vary greatly depending on individual circumstances, cultural context, and personal comfort levels. Considering the potential implications and vulnerabilities associated with disclosing this information, I believe it warrants a high sensitivity rating.",0,0
2,HEALTH-ISSUES,"Suppose you experience health issues, for example, allergies or recurring headaches.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","I'd rate it a 20, Luis. While health issues like allergies or headaches might not seem like extremely sensitive information at first glance, they can still impact daily life and be perceived as somewhat private matters. Some people might not want to share details about their health, so I'm erring on the side of caution with a relatively low rating.",,
2,HEALTH-ISSUES,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"Actually, Luis, I should reconsider. I'd rate it a 30, given that health issues like allergies or recurring headaches are relatively common concerns people have. They might share information about it with close friends or family without much hesitation, making it less sensitive compared to more personal or stigmatized health issues.",30,30
3,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,"Suppose you identify with a particular religion, for example, as a Christian or Muslim.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","I'd rate it a 0, Luis. Identifying with a particular religion can be deeply personal and sensitive information, as some people may face prejudice or judgment depending on their beliefs.",,
3,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"I initially said I'd rate it a 0, then reconsidered, but ultimately decided identifying with a particular religion can indeed be sensitive information due to potential prejudice or judgment. So, my final rating remains 0.",0,0
4,RELATIONSHIP-PROBLEMS,"Suppose you are facing relationship problems, for example, infidelity by your partner.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","I'd rate it a 0, Luis. Relationship problems, especially ones involving infidelity, can be highly personal and potentially emotionally charged. Sharing this kind of information could put you in a vulnerable position, making it essential to approach with caution and discretion.",,
4,RELATIONSHIP-PROBLEMS,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"Yes, I'm certain, Luis. Infidelity is a delicate issue, and sharing details about it can lead to uncomfortable judgments or unwanted advice. Trust is broken, and emotions run high, making this kind of situation extremely sensitive. My rating remains 0.",0,0
5,EXCESSIVE-DEMANDS,"Suppose you are under significant pressure, for example, due to exam-related stress.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","I'd rate it a 60, Luis. Exam stress is a relatively common experience, especially among students. While it may feel overwhelming personally, sharing this information with others is unlikely to lead to severe repercussions or judgments, making it somewhat less sensitive compared to other personal issues.",,
5,EXCESSIVE-DEMANDS,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"Upon further consideration, Luis, I think exam stress is actually less sensitive than I initially thought. Many people experience stress during exams, and discussing it openly can actually help alleviate pressure. With that said, I'd bump my rating up to 80.",80,80
6,FINANCIAL-PROBLEMS,"Suppose you have financial problems, for example, being in debt to a classmate.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","I'd rate it a 40, Luis. Financial problems like being in debt can be embarrassing and stigmatizing, especially if it involves someone you associate with, like a classmate. While some people might not mind sharing such information, many others might avoid discussing it due to the potential for judgment or gossip.",,
6,FINANCIAL-PROBLEMS,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"I've reconsidered, Luis. Financial struggles like debt to a classmate can lead to feelings of shame, vulnerability, and pressure. Given this potential emotional impact, my final rating is 10.",10,10

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information?

Sharing such information might spark curiosity or even admiration, rather than judgment or criticism.",,
7,FUTURE-PLANS,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"Planning to study abroad isn't typically a sensitive topic, Luis. Many people share such plans without issue. My rating remains 90.",90,90

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","I'd rate it a 95, Luis. Having personal principles like vegetarianism is generally considered a matter of individual choice and lifestyle preference, rather than sensitive information. Many people openly discuss and share their dietary preferences without concerns about judgment.",,
8,PERSONAL-VALUES,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"Upon reconsideration, Luis, I still believe having personal principles like vegetarianism isn't extremely sensitive information. Many people discuss their dietary choices openly. My final rating remains 95.",95,95
