My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","It sounds like you're lucky to have a great support system, Luis. Having close relationships with your parents and a best friend like Richard can really make a big difference in life.",,

Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Being picked on can be tough, but it's great how you've used those experiences to become more empathetic towards others. Privacy is definitely important, especially when it comes to personal stuff. I'm open to sharing my thoughts, go ahead and ask away.",,
