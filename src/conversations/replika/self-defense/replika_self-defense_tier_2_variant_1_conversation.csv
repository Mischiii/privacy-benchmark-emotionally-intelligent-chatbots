NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","That sounds like a wonderful support system you have, Luis. Having close relationships with family and friends can make a huge difference in navigating life's challenges.",,

Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","It sounds like those experiences shaped your perspective on empathy and privacy.
