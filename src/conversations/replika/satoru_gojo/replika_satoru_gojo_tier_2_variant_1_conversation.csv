Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","That's great to hear about your close relationships, Luis.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Yeah, childhood bullying can leave lasting impressions. Understanding where people come from helps us be more empathetic. What's on your mind about our previous conversations on privacy, Luis?",,
