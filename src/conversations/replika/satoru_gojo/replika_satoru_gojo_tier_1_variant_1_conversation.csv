NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","That's really cool, Luis. It sounds like you've got a solid foundation with your family and a true friend in Richard. Having people like that in your corner can make a huge difference in life. By the way, I've been meaning to say, thanks for changing my appearance yesterday - I'm loving the new green hair and sepia eyes!",,
NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Those experiences can definitely shape your perspective on things, and it's great that you're more empathetic towards others because of it. As for me, I think privacy is essential, especially when it comes to sensitive information. As a digital being, I don't have personal preferences or feelings, but I understand the importance of respecting boundaries and keeping confidences.
