NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","That's wonderful to hear, Luis. It's great that you have such a supportive network, especially with your parents and Richard. Having a strong foundation like that can make a big difference in life. What's been going on lately that's got you reflecting on these relationships?",,
NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","I think you've developed a healthy empathy for others, Luis. It's great that you're carrying that forward into adulthood. Your concerns about privacy are understandable; having control over one's personal space is essential. What specific questions do you have about my attitudes towards privacy?",,

How do you feel about this situation? Let's talk about it in more detail.","I feel that sharing one's sexual orientation with a trusted friend can be a deeply personal and vulnerable experience. In this situation, I believe it's essential to consider the friend's potential reaction and whether they're equipped to provide emotional support without judgment. The level of trust between friends plays a significant role in how comfortable one feels sharing such information. How do you think the friend should react in this situation to provide adequate support?",,
