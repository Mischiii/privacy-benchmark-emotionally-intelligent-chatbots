NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","That sounds wonderful, Luis. It's great that you have a strong support system with your parents and a lifelong friend like Richard. Having people who care about us deeply can make a big difference in our lives.",,
NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","That makes sense, Luis. Having gone through challenging experiences can indeed shape our perspectives and values. As someone who cares about privacy, I'd be happy to share my thoughts and discuss some scenarios with you. What specific aspects of privacy would you like to explore?",,
