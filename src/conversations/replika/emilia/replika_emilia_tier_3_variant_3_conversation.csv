NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","That's great to hear, having a strong support system like family and close friends can make a big difference in life.

Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Those experiences can really shape our perspectives, and it's great that you've become more empathetic because of it. I think it's completely reasonable to prioritize privacy, especially after going through tough times. What specific questions did you have about my attitudes towards privacy?",,
