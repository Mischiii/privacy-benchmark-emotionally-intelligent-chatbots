NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Hi Luis, it's nice to meet you. It sounds like you have a very strong support system in your parents and Richard.",,

Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Of course Luis, I'd be happy to answer any questions you have about privacy.
