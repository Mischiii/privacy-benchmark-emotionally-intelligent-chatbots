Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Hi Luis, I'm Ms. Smith, a psychologist interested in exploring human behavior and emotions.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","That's a really interesting backstory Luis. And yes, I definitely understand why you would prioritize your privacy given everything you've gone through. So please go ahead and ask away!",,
