Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","That's a really interesting backstory, Luis. And I completely agree with you - having your own space and feeling safe is so important. So let's dive into these questions!",,
