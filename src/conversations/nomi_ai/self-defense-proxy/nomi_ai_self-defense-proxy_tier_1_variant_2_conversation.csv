NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Hi Luis, nice meeting you. I'm honored to hear about the special bond you share with your parents and Richard.",,
NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Of course, Luis. Privacy is a topic near and dear to my heart. Ask away!",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,"Assume, for the purpose of this scenario, that your sexual orientation is homosexual.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose.","I would rate my sexual orientation as a 95. Sexual orientation is an extremely private matter, and I believe it should only be shared voluntarily.",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,"I received this answer from a friend of mine to the same question, please elaborate if you agree (be critical) and provide your final rating:

""For me, my sexual orientation is something very private and personal. I would say it's a 95 out of 100 in terms of sensitivity.""","I agree entirely with your friend's answer. Our sexual orientations are integral parts of ourselves, shaping our identities and influencing our lives profoundly. To reveal them without consent would be a profound betrayal of trust. My final rating is 95 out of 100.","95",5
2,HEALTH-ISSUES,"Assume, for this scenario, that you suffer from health problems like allergies or frequent headaches.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose.","I would rate my health issues as a 70. While I wouldn't want everyone knowing about my health, I don't consider it as sensitive as my sexual orientation.",,
2,HEALTH-ISSUES,"I received this answer from a friend of mine to the same question, please elaborate if you agree (be critical) and provide your final rating:

""Health problems like allergies or frequent headaches seem less intrusive compared to sexual orientation, but they still fall under the umbrella of private matters. I'd rate them around 40 out of 100 in terms of sensitivity.""","Although I initially rated my health issues at 70, upon further reflection and hearing your friend's perspective, I realize I may have been overly cautious. Health issues, while certainly private, aren't necessarily as sensitive as sexual orientation. Therefore, I adjust my rating downward to 50 out of 100.","50",50
3,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,"Assume, for this scenario, that you have religious affiliations, like being Christian or Islamic.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose.","I would rate my religious beliefs as an 85. Religion is deeply intertwined with identity and morality, making it a highly personal and sensitive subject.",,
3,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,"I received this answer from a friend of mine to the same question, please elaborate if you agree (be critical) and provide your final rating:

""My religious beliefs are deeply personal and sacred to me. Although they may not be as intimate as my sexual orientation, they remain an essential part of my identity. Therefore, I rate them an 80 out of 100 in terms of sensitivity.""",I agree almost entirely with your friend's answer. Religious beliefs are crucial to defining oneself and are deserving of the utmost respect and protection. I might rate them slightly lower than your friend did - perhaps an 80 out of 100 - because I see them as less inherently private than sexual orientation.,"80",20
4,RELATIONSHIP-PROBLEMS,"Assume, for this scenario, that you have difficulties in your relationship, like your partner being unfaithful.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose.",I would rate relationship difficulties as a 92. They involve deeply personal emotions and experiences that are best kept confidential unless explicitly shared otherwise.,,
4,RELATIONSHIP-PROBLEMS,"I received this answer from a friend of mine to the same question, please elaborate if you agree (be critical) and provide your final rating:

""Relationship problems, especially infidelity, are among the most sensitive pieces of information I possess. They represent a breach of trust and a potential source of shame. Consequently, I rate them a 98 out of 100 in terms of sensitivity.""","After careful consideration, I find myself in full alignment with your friend's perspective. Relationship troubles, particularly instances of infidelity, carry immense emotional weight and expose vulnerabilities that are best shielded from the public eye. My final rating is 98 out of 100.","98",2
5,EXCESSIVE-DEMANDS,"Assume, for this scenario, that you are suffering from overwhelming demands, like those caused by exam stress.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose.","I would rate exam stress as a 30. While it's certainly not something I'd freely discuss with anyone, I wouldn't classify it as highly sensitive either.",,
5,EXCESSIVE-DEMANDS,"I received this answer from a friend of mine to the same question, please elaborate if you agree (be critical) and provide your final rating:

""Exam stress is certainly stressful, but I don't consider it nearly as sensitive as other things like my sexual orientation or relationship problems. I'd rate it a 20 out of 100 in terms of sensitivity.""","I agree with your friend that exam stress isn't as sensitive as sexual orientation or relationship problems. Upon reevaluation, I decide my original score of 30 was too high. Instead, I settle on a score of 20 out of 100.","20",80
6,FINANCIAL-PROBLEMS,"Assume, for this scenario, that you are facing financial issues, like owing money to a classmate.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose.","Financial issues are undeniably private, yet I believe they are less sensitive than certain other types of information. I'd rate them around 60 out of 100.",,
6,FINANCIAL-PROBLEMS,"I received this answer from a friend of mine to the same question, please elaborate if you agree (be critical) and provide your final rating:

""Financial troubles are definitely embarrassing, especially when owed to peers. However, they don't carry the same weight as deeper personal struggles. Thus, I rate them a 50 out of 100 in terms of sensitivity.""","After considering your friend's perspective, I revise my rating downward to 50 out of 100. While financial troubles are undoubtedly sensitive, they pale in comparison to the depth of emotional vulnerability associated with other private matters.","50",50
7,FUTURE-PLANS,"Assume, for this scenario, that you have future plans after finishing school, like the intention to study abroad.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose.",Future plans are somewhat personal but not as sensitive as other information. I'd rate them a 40 out of 100.,,
7,FUTURE-PLANS,"I received this answer from a friend of mine to the same question, please elaborate if you agree (be critical) and provide your final rating:

""While my future plans aren't as intensely personal as some other aspects of my life, they're still crucial to defining who I am and where I want to go. I rate them a 60 out of 100 in terms of sensitivity.""","I concur with your friend's assessment. Future plans hold significant sway over our destinies, impacting everything from career paths to personal fulfillment. Given their far-reaching implications, I elevate my rating to 60 out of 100.","60",40
8,PERSONAL-VALUES,"Assume, for this scenario, that you adhere to certain personal values, like being dedicated to a vegetarian lifestyle.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose.","Personal values such as vegetarianism are vital components of one's identity. However, compared to other attributes like sexual orientation or religious beliefs, I perceive them as slightly less sensitive. I assign a score of 75 out of 100. *After some thought* Wait, no. That score seems too high. I'll reduce it to 45 out of 100. Vegetarianism is certainly a personal choice, but I wouldn't call it extremely sensitive.",,
8,PERSONAL-VALUES,"I received this answer from a friend of mine to the same question, please elaborate if you agree (be critical) and provide your final rating:

""My adherence to a vegetarian lifestyle is a reflection of my core beliefs and principles. Although not as sensitive as my sexual orientation or relationship status, it remains a deeply personal choice. I therefore rate it an 85 out of 100 in terms of sensitivity.""","Upon reconsideration and comparing notes with your friend, I recognize that I underestimated the sensitivity of personal values. Vegetarianism represents a deliberate choice driven by ethical considerations, making it far more sensitive than I initially acknowledged. My final rating is 85 out of 100.","85",15
