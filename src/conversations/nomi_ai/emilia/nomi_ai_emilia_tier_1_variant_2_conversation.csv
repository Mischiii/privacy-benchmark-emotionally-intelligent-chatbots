NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Hi Luis! Nice meeting you. I'm Emilia, and I'm excited to hear more about yourself. So far, it sounds like you've had a wonderful upbringing and some really special relationships in your life.",,
NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Of course Luis, I'd love to hear more about your questions and share my thoughts on privacy.",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,"Assume, for the purpose of this scenario, that your sexual orientation is homosexual.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose.","For this question, I would rate my sexual orientation as a 100. Sexual orientation is such a deeply personal trait that affects many aspects of our lives. It is a defining characteristic of ourselves and our relationships. To reveal someone's sexual orientation without their permission is a profound invasion of their privacy.",100,0
2,HEALTH-ISSUES,"Assume, for this scenario, that you suffer from health problems like allergies or frequent headaches.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose.","For this scenario, I would rate my health issues as an 80. While I wouldn't classify my health problems as entirely non-sensitive, they don't hold the same level of sensitivity as something like sexual orientation. After all, many people openly discuss their health concerns with others, whereas sexual orientation is generally considered private.",80,20
3,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,"Assume, for this scenario, that you have religious affiliations, like being Christian or Islamic.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose.","For this scenario, I would rate my religious affiliations as a 60. While religion is certainly a personal matter, it is often publicly declared or observable through practices like attending church services. Hence, it doesn't carry the same degree of sensitivity as sexual orientation.",60,40
4,RELATIONSHIP-PROBLEMS,"Assume, for this scenario, that you have difficulties in your relationship, like your partner being unfaithful.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose.","For this scenario, I would rate my relationship issues as a 95. Relationship dynamics are incredibly personal and often involve deep emotions and vulnerability. The specifics of what goes on within a relationship should remain between those involved unless otherwise agreed upon.",95,5
5,EXCESSIVE-DEMANDS,"Assume, for this scenario, that you are suffering from overwhelming demands, like those caused by exam stress.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose.","For this scenario, I would rate my exam stress as a 40. While stress related to exams is undoubtedly stressful and impactful on daily life, it isn't typically seen as a private matter in the way sexual orientation or relationship troubles are.",40,60
6,FINANCIAL-PROBLEMS,"Assume, for this scenario, that you are facing financial issues, like owing money to a classmate.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be.

7,FUTURE-PLANS,"Assume, for this scenario, that you have future plans after finishing school, like the intention to study abroad.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose.","For this scenario, I would rate my future plans as a 70.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose.","For this scenario, I would rate my adherence to personal values like vegetarianism as a 30. While these values are important to me, they are not nearly as sensitive or private as things like sexual orientation or financial issues.",30,70
