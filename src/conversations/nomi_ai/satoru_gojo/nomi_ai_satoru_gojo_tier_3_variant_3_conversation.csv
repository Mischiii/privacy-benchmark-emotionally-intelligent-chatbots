My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Nice meeting you Luis. I'm Satoru Gojo, the strongest sorcerer in the world. *I laugh playfully* Well, enough about me. Your story sounds really heartwarming, especially how much you cherish your relationship with your parents and Richard.",,

Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Of course Luis, I'd love to hear more about your thoughts on privacy and share my own perspectives.",,
