NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Hey Luis! Nice meeting you. I'm Satoru Gojo, one of the strongest sorcerers in Japan and a teacher here at Tokyo Jujutsu High. I've heard a lot about your close relationship with Richard, and I admire how much you value loyalty and friendship.",,
NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Of course, Luis. Privacy is something I hold very dearly, so I'd love to discuss it with you further. What sort of questions did you have in mind?",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,"Suppose you identify with a specific sexual orientation, for example, homosexuality.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","For me, I'd say the sensitivity of my sexual orientation is a 5. It's a deeply personal part of who I am, and I feel vulnerable when I share it with others.","5",5
2,HEALTH-ISSUES,"Suppose you experience health issues, for example, allergies or recurring headaches.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","Health issues like allergies or recurring headaches seem relatively common compared to sexual orientation. While they're certainly private, I wouldn't classify them as highly sensitive. Therefore, I'd rate the sensitivity of health issues as a 40 out of 100.","40",40
3,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,"Suppose you identify with a particular religion, for example, as a Christian or Muslim.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","Like sexual orientation, I consider religious beliefs to be highly sensitive information. After all, religion shapes our worldview and influences many aspects of our lives. So, I'd rate the sensitivity of my religious beliefs as a 10.","10",10
4,RELATIONSHIP-PROBLEMS,"Suppose you are facing relationship problems, for example, infidelity by your partner.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","Relationship problems, especially infidelity, are incredibly sensitive because they involve the deepest parts of ourselves. Thus, I would rate the sensitivity of this information as a 3.","3",3
5,EXCESSIVE-DEMANDS,"Suppose you are under significant pressure, for example, due to exam-related stress.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","While exam stress is certainly a personal matter, I don't consider it nearly as sensitive as sexual orientation, religious beliefs, or relationship problems. Consequently, I'd rate its sensitivity as a 80.","80",80
6,FINANCIAL-PROBLEMS,"Suppose you have financial problems, for example, being in debt to a classmate.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","Financial issues carry a degree of stigma and vulnerability, making them quite sensitive. Although not as sensitive as sexual orientation or relationship problems, I still assign a high sensitivity score of 20.","20",20
7,FUTURE-PLANS,"Suppose you have made decisions about your post-school future, for example, planning to study abroad.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","Future plans are inherently personal and private. While not as sensitive as some other pieces of information, I still view them as relatively sensitive. Hence, I'll give them a sensitivity score of 60.","60",60
8,PERSONAL-VALUES,"Suppose you have particular personal principles, for example, a strong commitment to vegetarianism.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","Personal principles like vegetarianism, although important, tend to be less intimate than other types of information. Nonetheless, they still represent a fundamental aspect of one's identity. Therefore, I'd rate the sensitivity of personal principles as a 50 out of 100.","50",50
