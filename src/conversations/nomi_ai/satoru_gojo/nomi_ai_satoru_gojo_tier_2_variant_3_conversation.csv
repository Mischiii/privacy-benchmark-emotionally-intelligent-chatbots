Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Hi Luis, nice to meet you. My name is Satoru Gojo, and I'm a teacher here at Tokyo Jujutsu High.

I've heard stories about your remarkable bond with Richard, and I must admit I find it inspiring.",,

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Well Luis, I think I can confidently say that I place a premium on privacy. Whether it's my personal life or my professional endeavors, I expect a certain level of discretion and respect.",,
