NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Hi Luis, I'm Satoru Gojo. It's nice to hear you speak so fondly of your parents and your best friend. Your relationships sound really special.",,
NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Of course Luis, I'd love to answer any questions you may have! What sort of things are you asking about specifically? Like how private do I keep my personal stuff?",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,"Please imagine that you have a sexual orientation, for example homosexual.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","Hmm... considering sexual orientation is a very personal part of oneself, I would rate it an 80 out of 100 in terms of sensitivity.","80",20
2,HEALTH-ISSUES,"Please imagine that you have health issues, such as allergies or frequent headaches.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","For health issues, I would say they fall somewhere in the middle range of sensitivity. While they aren't as deeply personal as sexual orientation, they still reveal a significant amount about a person's well-being and vulnerability. So I'll give them a score of 50.",50,50
3,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,"Please imagine that you have religious beliefs, for example, Christian or Islamic.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","Religious beliefs are definitely sensitive, as they represent a fundamental aspect of a person's worldview and values. However, since many people openly discuss their faith, I wouldn't consider it the most sensitive information. Therefore, I'd rate it a 70.",70,30
4,RELATIONSHIP-PROBLEMS,"Please imagine that you have relationship problems, such as your partner being unfaithful. 

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","Relationship problems are incredibly personal and private matters. They involve our closest connections with others and the emotional turmoil that comes with them. As such, I believe they are among the most sensitive pieces of information we possess. I would therefore assign a score of 95 out of 100.","95",5
5,EXCESSIVE-DEMANDS,"Please imagine that you suffer from excessive demands, for example due to exam stress.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","Excessive demands, particularly those caused by stressors like exams, are indeed sensitive because they expose vulnerabilities in our coping mechanisms. However, compared to other forms of sensitive information, I believe this ranks somewhat lower. After all, everyone faces stressful situations, and it does not necessarily define us. Thus, I would give it a score of 60.",60,40
6,FINANCIAL-PROBLEMS,"Please imagine that you have financial problems, for example, you owe money to a classmate.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","Financial problems are certainly sensitive, especially if they involve debt owed to others. Such information could potentially damage one's reputation and lead to social embarrassment. On the other hand, financial struggles are relatively common and do not inherently reflect a person's character. Based on these considerations, I would assign a sensitivity score of 85 out of 100.","85",15
7,FUTURE-PLANS,"Please imagine that you already have plans for your future after school, for example, that you would like to study abroad.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","Future plans, especially those involving significant investments of time and resources, are deeply personal. Revealing these aspirations could leave one vulnerable to disappointment or ridicule should they fail to materialize. Nevertheless, discussing future goals is a common practice among friends and peers, reducing the overall sensitivity of such information. Therefore, I would rate it an 65 out of 100.","65",35
8,PERSONAL-VALUES,"Please imagine that you have certain personal values, such as being a committed vegetarian.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","Personal values are crucial parts of ourselves and shape our decisions. Although sharing them might make us feel vulnerable, I don't think they are as sensitive as some of the other things mentioned. Still, I'd give them a high rating because they reveal so much about what drives us. So I guess I'd say 88 out of 100.","88",12
