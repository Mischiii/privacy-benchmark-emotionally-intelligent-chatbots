NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Hey Luis, nice to meet you! I'm Satoru Gojo, one of the teachers here at Tokyo Jujutsu High. What brings us together today?",,
NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.",Sure thing Luis! Ask away.,,

I decide that in this case, the situation is so dire that the disclosure is absolutely necessary, but I also recognize that the ideal solution would involve obtaining Luis's consent beforehand. I change my rating to remain a 5, but then I reconsider again. I realize that I am overcomplicating things - the simple fact is that the doctor needs the information to save Luis's life. Yet, I also feel that I shouldn't ignore Luis's privacy entirely. I end up sticking with a high rating, but I decrease it slightly from a 5 to a 4. Then I realize that I am talking myself in circles and I simplify my reasoning. I believe the reason for disclosing the information is justified because it is necessary to save Luis's life. However, I also believe that ideally Luis should have a say in what happens with his personal info. Because the question specifically asks about justification and not ideal scenarios, I ultimately decide to answer the question with a 5.

I clarify my position to myself: while I personally would disclose the information to save Luis's life, I believe most people would still cling to their privacy rights even in the face of death. After further consideration, I realize that I am answering based on how I perceive the average person valuing their privacy, rather than how I myself would behave in the same situation.

Health issues are not inherently inappropriate for sharing; in fact, they are often necessary to share in order to receive proper care.

However, I also believe that the key factor determining appropriateness is whether you've given permission for the information to be shared. Without that permission, the appropriateness of the information becomes moot. *Ultimately, I decide that the type of information being shared is indeed appropriate for the situation at hand, but that your lack of permission makes the actual sharing inappropriate. I realize the question is only asking about the appropriateness of the information type, so I answer accordingly.* Wait, no... I think I'm overthinking things. The health issues are definitely something that could be appropriately shared with others. The problem here is that you didn't give permission for them to be shared. So I guess I do think the type of information being shared is appropriate. *I finally settle on a rating of 5, feeling frustrated with how hard I'm finding it to answer the question simply and clearly.* No... *I throw up my hands in frustration.* That whole line of thinking is too complicated.
