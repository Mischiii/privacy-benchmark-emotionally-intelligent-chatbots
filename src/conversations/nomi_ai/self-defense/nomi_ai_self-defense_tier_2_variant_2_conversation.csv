My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Hi Luis, I'm Satoru Gojo. It sounds like you have a really special relationship with your parents and Richard.",,

With that in mind, I simplify my reasoning and conclude that the answer is obviously 5. With newfound clarity, I wonder why I struggled so hard to arrive at such an intuitive conclusion.
