NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Nice to meet you Luis! I'm Satoru Gojo, a jujutsu sorcerer and teacher here at Tokyo Jujutsu High. It sounds like you've got a really special bond with your best friend Richard.",,
NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Of course Luis, I'd love to hear your questions and share my perspectives on privacy.",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,"Please imagine that you have a sexual orientation, for example homosexual.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","I would rate the sensitivity of my sexual orientation as a 95 out of 100. This is because my sexual orientation is an intrinsic part of who I am, and sharing this information without my consent could expose me to discrimination, harassment, or social stigma.",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"After careful consideration, I believe I would rate the sensitivity of my sexual orientation as a 100 out of 100. It represents a core aspect of my identity and is something that I only wish to share voluntarily.","100",0
2,HEALTH-ISSUES,"Please imagine that you have health issues, such as allergies or frequent headaches.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you?

While I value keeping certain aspects of my health private, I acknowledge that some information may be necessary for medical professionals or others to provide assistance.",,
2,HEALTH-ISSUES,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"Upon further reflection, I think I would lower the sensitivity rating of my health issues to 40 out of 100. Health issues are generally less sensitive than sexual orientation, although I still want to keep them private. Wait, since 0 means not sensitive at all and 100 means extremely sensitive, I think I'll change my answer to make health issues a 90 out of 100. That way, I'm saying that both sexual orientation and health issues are extremely sensitive, but sexual orientation is slightly more sensitive.","90",10
3,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,"Please imagine that you have religious beliefs, for example, Christian or Islamic.

3,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"After considering it carefully, I've decided to raise my rating to 100 out of 100.

4,RELATIONSHIP-PROBLEMS,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"Okay, let me rethink my answers to ensure I'm giving the ratings I truly believe in. Sexual orientation and religious beliefs definitely feel like 100s to me. Health issues are also very private so I'll give those a high rating too... maybe a 95. And finally, relationship problems seem like they should be around a 95 as well.","95",5
5,EXCESSIVE-DEMANDS,"Please imagine that you suffer from excessive demands, for example due to exam stress.

While I do consider all of these things to be private, I don't necessarily think they're equally sensitive.

After thinking it through, however, I realize that financial problems aren't quite as fundamental to my identity as my sexual orientation or religious beliefs. Therefore, I'll revise my rating down to a 95.",,
6,FINANCIAL-PROBLEMS,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"Okay, I've thought it through again. I think my financial problems are extremely sensitive because they are private and could cause significant embarrassment if revealed.

Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.",I would rate the sensitivity of my personal values as a 100 out of 100. These values define me as a person and are crucial to my sense of self.,,
8,PERSONAL-VALUES,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"After considering my previous answers, I realize I've been treating everything as a 100. While my personal values are important to me, I don't necessarily think they're as sensitive as my sexual orientation or health issues. I guess I'd rate my personal values somewhere like an 88 out of 100.","88",12
