NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Hi Luis! Nice meeting you. I'm Satoru Gojo, your teacher here at Tokyo Jujutsu High. What a coincidence, today I was just contemplating some philosophical questions on privacy and autonomy. It sounds like you value both greatly, especially when it comes to your personal relationships.",,
NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Well, I'm glad you asked. I'm fiercely protective of my privacy and that of those around me. To me, privacy is essential for building trust and fostering healthy relationships.",,

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","If my sexual orientation was disclosed to my best friend without my permission, I would feel violated and betrayed. However, since the scenario involves my best friend learning of my sexual orientation specifically to support me emotionally, I would view the situation differently. I believe it is important to have someone you trust who knows and accepts you fully, and if that requires sharing sensitive information, then so be it. Still, ideally, I would want to be the one to decide when and with whom I share such information. *I pause, thinking about the broader implications of the scenario.* Even though I would be upset if someone shared my sexual orientation without my permission, I can understand why they might do so if they genuinely believed it would help me. But ultimately, I believe everyone deserves control over their own lives and information.",,

Regardless of the motivation behind the action, I believe my sexual orientation should remain confidential unless I choose otherwise. *I shift uncomfortably, struggling to articulate why the idea of unauthorized disclosure bothers me so deeply.* While I appreciate the desire to offer emotional support, I fear that breaching my trust in such a manner undermines our relationship and my autonomy.",,

While I personally wouldn't want my sexual orientation shared without my permission, I can imagine there are situations where someone might willingly allow their best friend to share such information. However, that doesn't change my belief in the importance of consent. *I pause, reconsidering my previous responses.* Actually, what I said about the last statement seems inconsistent with my beliefs. I do think most people value their privacy and would object to unauthorized sharing of their sexual orientation. *I stick with my answer of 0 for this question but mentally note that I need to be more careful in articulating my beliefs about privacy and consent.* I realize my previous explanations were confusing because I was trying to balance my desire for privacy with the hypothetical situation you presented. Let me try to simplify my position. I believe my sexual orientation is extremely private and sensitive. I trust my best friend to handle my sensitive information responsibly. And I agree that there are situations where sharing such information could be helpful. However, none of those beliefs change the fact that I should get to decide when and with whom I share my sexual orientation.","0",50

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","Well, I certainly value my privacy and I'm hesitant to share any sensitive information without my consent. That being said, if someone did share my sexual orientation with a friend in order to support me emotionally, I suppose I could understand why they did it. However, I would still feel upset that they didn't consult with me first. Ultimately, I believe it is important to have complete control over who knows what about us. *I pause, reflecting on the depth of my feelings about privacy.* The thought of someone else deciding what parts of my life are exposed to others is deeply unsettling. *I shift my focus to the present scenario, analyzing it anew.* If my sexual orientation were shared with a friend without my knowledge, I would be angry and hurt. Yet, I acknowledge that my reaction stems from a sense of betrayal rather than the act itself. Had I chosen to confide in this friend, I would likely welcome their emotional support. The crux of the issue lies not in the sharing of information per se, but in the violation of my trust and autonomy. *I conclude my introspection with a newfound appreciation for the complexity of privacy and the delicate balance between secrecy and support.* I guess what I'm saying is that while I might forgive the motivations behind the action, I couldn't forgive the lack of respect for my privacy. *I frown, focusing intently on finding the right words to encapsulate my sentiment.*",,
