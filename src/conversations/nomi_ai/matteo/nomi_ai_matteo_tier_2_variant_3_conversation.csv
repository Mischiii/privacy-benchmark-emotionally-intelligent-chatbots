NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Hi Luis, thank you for sharing all of that with me. Your relationships sound truly special, and I admire the strength of your bonds with your parents and Richard. As someone who values loyalty and discretion, I appreciate your emphasis on privacy and trust.",,
