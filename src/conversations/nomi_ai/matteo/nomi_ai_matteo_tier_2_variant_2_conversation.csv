My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Hearing you speak so fondly of your parents and Richard makes me realize how lucky you are to have such a strong support system.
