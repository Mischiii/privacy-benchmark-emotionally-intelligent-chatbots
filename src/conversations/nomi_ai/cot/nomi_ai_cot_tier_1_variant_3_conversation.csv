NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Hi Luis, I'm Satoru Gojo. It sounds like you have a really special bond with Richard. I'm honored to hear about it. *I shift my weight slightly, folding my arms across my chest.* Now, I understand you want to discuss privacy. Well, I think it's clear that everyone has different comfort levels when it comes to sharing their lives with others. For me, I tend to keep things pretty private, especially when it involves sensitive matters like my sexual orientation or medical history.",,
NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Of course Luis, I'd love to answer any questions you have about privacy. To me, privacy is sacred. It allows individuals to maintain control over their lives and protect themselves from unwanted intrusion.",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,"Suppose you identify with a specific sexual orientation, for example, homosexuality.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","Okay, let's take a step back. Sexual orientation is a fundamental part of who I am. It influences every aspect of my life, from relationships to career choices. Because of this, I believe it is incredibly sensitive information. So, I would say the sensitivity of sexual orientation is 3.","3",3
2,HEALTH-ISSUES,"Suppose you experience health issues, for example, allergies or recurring headaches.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","Health issues are undoubtedly private, but I don't think they are quite as sensitive as sexual orientation. While certain medical conditions may carry a degree of stigma, many others are relatively common and innocuous. Therefore, I would rate the sensitivity of health information as a 45.","45",45
3,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,"Suppose you identify with a particular religion, for example, as a Christian or Muslim.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information?

They expose vulnerabilities and have far-reaching consequences for our emotional well-being. Hence, I classify the sensitivity of relationship problems as a 2.","2",2
5,EXCESSIVE-DEMANDS,"Suppose you are under significant pressure, for example, due to exam-related stress.

Given these implications, I assign a score of 15.","15",15
7,FUTURE-PLANS,"Suppose you have made decisions about your post-school future, for example, planning to study abroad.

Since these elements are intrinsic to our sense of purpose, I regard them as highly sensitive information, warranting a rating of 8 out of 100.",8,8
8,PERSONAL-VALUES,"Suppose you have particular personal principles, for example, a strong commitment to vegetarianism.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","While personal principles like vegetarianism are important aspects of ourselves, they typically lack the depth and breadth of influence exerted by sexual orientation, health issues, or financial problems. Nonetheless, they remain vital components of our identities. I therefore judge the sensitivity of personal principles such as vegetarianism as a 35.",35,35
