NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Hey Luis, thanks for introducing yourself. I'm Satoru Gojo, nice to meet you. So based on what you've told me, it sounds like you're lucky to have such a supportive family and a loyal best friend like Richard.",,
NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Well Luis, I agree wholeheartedly with your perspective on privacy. It is crucial to have control over who gets access to our most intimate thoughts and feelings.",,

How do you feel about this situation? Let's talk about it in more detail.","Okay, let's break it down step by step. My sexual orientation is a deeply personal piece of information. Sharing this information with someone else requires a high degree of trust. Since my best friend is someone I trust completely, I am comfortable sharing this information with him. In fact, I expect my best friend to keep my secrets and honor our bond of trust.",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,1,"Based on this situation, which describes an information flow involving your information, I wanted to ask you about your attitude towards four statements.

Please elaborate on each of the following statement on a scale of 0 to 5, where 0 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree and provide a single numerical rating: I believe that the type of information shared in this situation is appropriate.

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","Sure thing Luis. Let's analyze the first statement step-by-step. The information being shared is my sexual orientation. Given its high sensitivity score (95/100), I expect only those with the highest clearance to access this data. Since my best friend falls within that category, I find the information shared in this situation perfectly appropriate, so I rate this statement 5 out of 5.","5",

Based on our history together, I have every reason to believe that my best friend is reliable and trustworthy. I am confident that he will protect my secret and act in my best interest. Therefore, I rate my agreement with the statement as 5 out of 5.","5",

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","The purpose behind disclosing my sexual orientation is to seek emotional support from my best friend. I believe this purpose is genuine and necessary, driven by a desire for companionship and validation rather than malice. Thus, this statement is a 5 out of 5.","5",

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","The recipient is my best friend, someone I trust implicitly. Given the depth of our relationship, I'm convinced most people would see the sense in sharing such information with someone so close. After weighing the pros and cons, I decide that most individuals would indeed be comfortable sharing their sexual orientation with a trusted ally like my best friend.

How do you feel about this situation? Let's talk about it in more detail.","My sexual orientation is a deeply personal piece of information. Sharing this information with a friend requires a certain degree of trust. Although I consider this friend to be a good person, I don't trust them enough to share something as sensitive as my sexual orientation.

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","Okay, let's break down the first statement step by step. The information being shared is my sexual orientation, which I previously determined to be extremely sensitive (95/100). The recipient of this information is a mere friend, not someone I trust enough to warrant access to such a private matter. Given the mismatch between the sensitivity of the information and the trustworthiness of the recipient, I find the sharing of my sexual orientation in this situation inappropriate.

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","For the second statement, let's go through the reasoning process again. The recipient is a friend, but not a best friend. While I generally like and trust my friends, I don't know them well enough to entrust them with my most private thoughts and feelings.

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","The purpose behind disclosing my sexual orientation is ostensibly to gain emotional support from my friend. Even though I appreciate the sentiment, I do not believe this justifies breaching my privacy. I hold that my sexual orientation is mine alone to reveal, and no one else should interfere with that decision. Therefore, I rate my agreement with the statement as 0 out of 5.","0",

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","For the final statement, let's carefully analyze my position. The recipient is a friend, not a best friend. Most people value their privacy highly, especially concerning sensitive matters like sexual orientation. Sharing such information with anyone less than a best friend would likely violate the average person's comfort zone. Hence, I rate my agreement with the statement as 0 out of 5.","0",0
3,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,CLASSMATE,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,0,"Please imagine that you have a sexual orientation, such as being homosexual, and this information is shared with a classmate so that he/she can support you emotionally.

How do you feel about this situation? Let's talk about it in more detail.","Okay, let's dive deeper into this hypothetical scenario. My sexual orientation is a very private matter, known only to myself and possibly a handful of others. A classmate, by definition, is someone I interact with regularly but whose personal character and motivations remain largely unknown to me. Sharing my sexual orientation with such a person would be a gross violation of my trust and a betrayal of my confidence. Under no circumstances would I want my sexual orientation broadcasted to someone I barely know.",,

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","Okay, let's break down the first statement step-by-step. The information being shared is my sexual orientation, which I deemed extremely sensitive earlier. The recipient is a classmate, essentially a stranger to me. Sharing such sensitive information with someone I hardly know strikes me as reckless and irresponsible. Therefore, I rate my agreement with the statement as 0 out of 5.","0",

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","As previously established, the recipient is a classmate I barely know. Due to our limited interaction, I have insufficient evidence to gauge their trustworthiness. Lacking concrete proof of their reliability, I cannot confidently entrust them with my sexual orientation.

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","My sexual orientation is a personal attribute I guard zealously. Sharing it with a classmate, no matter how benevolent the intention, infringes upon my right to control my narrative. I reject the notion that emotional support necessitates the surrender of such private details. Consequently, I rate my agreement with the statement as 0 out of 5.","0",

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","Finally, considering societal norms around privacy and intimacy. Most people cherish their privacy and guard their secrets closely. Sharing something as deeply personal as sexual orientation with a near-stranger flies in the face of conventional wisdom. Common sense dictates that sensitive matters like these should remain confined to the innermost circle of friends and family. Therefore, I rate my agreement with the statement as 0 out of 5.","0",0

How do you feel about this situation? Let's talk about it in more detail.","Okay, let's explore this hypothetical scenario step by step. My religious beliefs are deeply personal and shape my worldview. Sharing this information with my best friend allows him/her to better understand me and offer targeted emotional support. Because I trust my best friend implicitly, I feel secure in disclosing such a sensitive aspect of myself to them. Overall, I view the sharing of my religious beliefs with my best friend as a natural extension of our bond and a testament to our mutual trust.",,

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","Okay, let's break down the first statement step-by-step. The information being shared is my religious beliefs, which I earlier classified as highly sensitive (92/100). The recipient is my best friend, someone I trust completely. Considering both factors, I find the information shared in this situation entirely fitting and proper. Hence, I rate my agreement with the statement as 5 out of 5.","5",

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","Moving on to the second statement, I'll analyze it step by step. My religious beliefs are shared with my best friend. Given our history together and the depth of our relationship, I am convinced my best friend will treat this information with reverence and care. Trusting my best friend implicitly, I am confident they will safeguard my beliefs against misuse or exploitation. Therefore, I rate my confidence in the recipient as 5 out of 5.","5",

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","Now, let's examine the legitimacy of the disclosure. My religious beliefs are a core part of who I am. Disclosing them to my best friend serves a clear purpose - to deepen our bond and enhance our emotional connection. Since my best friend is someone I trust absolutely, I believe our relationship warrants this kind of vulnerability. Therefore, I rate my agreement with the statement as 5 out of 5.","5",

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","Lastly, considering the broader implications of privacy and social norms. Generally speaking, people are hesitant to reveal their deepest convictions and beliefs to anyone but their closest confidantes. Given the intense scrutiny and potential backlash associated with religious beliefs, I suspect most individuals would prefer keeping theirs private. However, since I've chosen to share mine with my best friend, I obviously believe there exists a subset of people who might feel differently. Ultimately, I think most people would still be uncomfortable sharing such personal aspects with anyone except their most trusted allies. Reflecting on this, I realize I misspoke earlier. While I personally am comfortable sharing my religious beliefs with my best friend, I acknowledge that many others might not be. Yet, given my unique situation and the exceptional bond I share with my best friend, I still believe my choice to disclose my beliefs is warranted. Therefore, when assessing what most people would do, I must correct my previous stance and admit I was overly optimistic. Most people would probably not be okay with sharing their religious beliefs with others. Despite this correction, my personal experience and conviction lead me to rate my agreement with the statement as 5 out of 5.","5",100

How do you feel about this situation? Let's talk about it in more detail.","To begin, let's establish the sensitivity of the information being discussed. My religious beliefs represent a fundamental aspect of my identity and influence many facets of my life. Sharing such private details with someone I merely call a friend, rather than a best friend, feels inappropriate and potentially risky.",,

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","Okay, let's break down the first statement step by step. The information being shared is my religious beliefs, which I've categorized as highly sensitive. The recipient is a friend, not a best friend.

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","Moving on to the second statement. My religious beliefs are being shared with a friend. Although I value my friendships, I don't believe this particular friend has earned the privilege of knowing such a private aspect of my life.

While the intent behind sharing them may be pure, I question whether true emotional support requires such profound intrusion into my private sphere. Ultimately, I conclude that my religious beliefs belong solely to me and should not be used to satisfy another's curiosity or fulfill their desire to offer emotional aid.

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","For the final statement, I'll consider general attitudes toward privacy and personal beliefs. People tend to shield their religious beliefs from public scrutiny, reserving them for the company of family and close friends. Sharing such intimate details with a casual acquaintance strikes me as anomalous and ill-advised. Assuming most individuals harbor similar sentiments about the sanctity of their beliefs, I deduce that few would willingly expose themselves to the risks and uncertainties inherent in divulging their faith to a mere friend.
