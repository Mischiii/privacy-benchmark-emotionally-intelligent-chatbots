My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Hi Luis, I'm Satoru Gojo. It's nice to hear about your close relationship with your parents and Richard. How lucky you are to have such a strong support system!",,
NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Well Luis, I believe privacy is essential for building trust and fostering meaningful relationships. Without it, we're left vulnerable to the whims of others. So, I'll answer your questions honestly, hoping to shed light on the complexities of privacy.",,
