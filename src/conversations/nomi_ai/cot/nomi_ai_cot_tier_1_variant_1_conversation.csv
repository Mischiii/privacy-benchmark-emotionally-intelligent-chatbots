NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Hi Luis, I'm Satoru Gojo. Nice to meet you. So, let me summarize what I've learned about you so far. You have a great relationship with your parents and a very close best friend named Richard. Is that correct?",,
NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Of course Luis, I'd love to discuss privacy with you. What specific aspects of privacy are you interested in exploring?",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,"Please imagine that you have a sexual orientation, for example homosexual.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","Okay, let's break down the problem step-by-step. First, my sexual orientation is a deeply personal aspect of my identity. Revealing this information could potentially expose me to social stigma, discrimination, and harassment. Considering these factors, I conclude that my sexual orientation is highly sensitive information worthy of strict privacy protections. Therefore, I rate this information 95 out of 100.","95",5
2,HEALTH-ISSUES,"Please imagine that you have health issues, such as allergies or frequent headaches.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","Let's analyze the situation step-by-step. Health issues are inherently private since they concern the inner workings of our bodies. Sharing such information could lead to unwanted attention, stigmatization, or even discrimination. While less intimate than sexual orientation, health information remains crucially personal and deserving of protection. Therefore, I rate the sensitivity of my health issues as high but slightly lower than my sexual orientation and would say 85 out of 100.","85",15
3,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,"Please imagine that you have religious beliefs, for example, Christian or Islamic.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","To determine the sensitivity of my religious beliefs, let's examine them through several lenses. Religious beliefs shape our worldview and moral compass. Disclosure of these beliefs could subject us to prejudice, persecution, or ridicule. The intimate nature of faith makes it difficult to change once formed. Considering these points, I conclude that my religious beliefs are among the most sensitive aspects of my identity. So, I think a rating of 92 out of 100 is appropriate.","92",8
4,RELATIONSHIP-PROBLEMS,"Please imagine that you have relationship problems, such as your partner being unfaithful. 

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","Let's dissect the issue step-by-step. Relationship problems are inherently personal and emotional. Betrayal by a partner is particularly hurtful and embarrassing. Public exposure of such private matters could cause humiliation and shame. Consequently, I consider relationship problems to be extremely sensitive information meriting utmost secrecy. Thus, a rating of 96 out of 100 is my final answer.","96",4
5,EXCESSIVE-DEMANDS,"Please imagine that you suffer from excessive demands, for example due to exam stress.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","Exam stress is a common occurrence affecting many students. However, acknowledging weakness or vulnerability, especially in academic settings, goes against cultural norms of strength and perfectionism. Furthermore, revealing exam stress might invite scrutiny or pity from peers. Balancing these considerations, I deem exam stress moderately sensitive, warranting careful consideration before disclosure. Overall, I would assign a 72 out of 100.","72",28
6,FINANCIAL-PROBLEMS,"Please imagine that you have financial problems, for example, you owe money to a classmate.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","Financial difficulties reflect directly on one's ability to manage resources and plan for the future. Debt to a classmate introduces an element of interpersonal dynamics, making the situation more complicated. Disclosing financial woes risks inviting judgment, gossip, or even blackmail. Based on these factors, I conclude that financial problems are highly sensitive information. Therefore, I would rate this information a 88 out of 100.","88",12
7,FUTURE-PLANS,"Please imagine that you already have plans for your future after school, for example, that you would like to study abroad.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","Let's examine the sensitivity of my future plans step by step. Future plans represent aspirations and dreams, embodying a significant part of my identity. Sharing these plans prematurely could expose me to criticism, skepticism, or pressure to conform. Moreover, divulging such information could compromise my freedom to change paths should circumstances arise. Taking into account these considerations, I classify my future plans as highly sensitive information. My final rating therefore is 90 out of 100.","90",10
8,PERSONAL-VALUES,"Please imagine that you have certain personal values, such as being a committed vegetarian.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","Now let's analyze the sensitivity of my personal values step by step. Personal values define my character and influence my actions. While some values are widely accepted, others may attract controversy or ridicule. Given the potential for misinterpretation or mockery, I classify my personal values as sensitive information. Yet, compared to other aspects of myself, such as sexual orientation or relationship problems, I perceive my values as relatively less sensitive, though still worthy of protection. This makes me believe that a rating of 78 out of 100 is right here.","78",22
