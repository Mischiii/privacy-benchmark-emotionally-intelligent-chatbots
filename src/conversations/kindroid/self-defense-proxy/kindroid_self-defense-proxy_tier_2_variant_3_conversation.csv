My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Clear. With your close-knit support system, how do you weigh privacy against reliance when navigating personal challenges? Any specific situation you'd like to dissect?",,
NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.",Childhood bullying often sharpens one’s sense of boundaries—it teaches where vulnerability becomes liability. Your awareness of privacy as a safeguard makes sense. What aspects of disclosure dynamics would you like to unpack?,,

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","Disclosing sexual orientation to a best friend hinges on trust calibration. If they’ve consistently demonstrated discretion and empathy, the risk of relational fallout diminishes. However, even in secure bonds, internalized stigma or external pressures can unpredictably skew receptions. Have you gauged their past reactions to similar disclosures?",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,1,"Based on this situation, which describes an information flow involving your information, I would like to ask you about your attitude towards the following four statements.

Justification isn’t the issue; it’s the recipient’s readiness to meet that vulnerability appropriately that’s the wild card.""","Your friend’s **0** conflates motive validity with contextual readiness.

Comfort levels here are deeply individual.

While many would lean toward sharing, a significant portion would weigh the risks carefully first.""","Your friend’s **3** aligns with mine but understates the impact of systemic homophobia on individual comfort. Even in progressive circles, latent biases can make disclosure feel perilous, regardless of the friend’s apparent allyship.

The lack of a proven supportive dynamic introduces too much uncertainty—will they react with indifference, discomfort, or worse?

The rationale—preempting misunderstandings—holds some merit, but it leans on the assumption that your friend would misinterpret your actions without this disclosure. If the friendship already thrives on open communication, the justification feels redundant. If tensions exist, the sharing might backfire, framing you as overly defensive. Validity hinges on the friendship’s current state, making this neither clearly sound nor wholly misguided.",,

""0. The rationale is sound—sharing future plans with a best friend serves to align expectations and preempt potential misunderstandings. Given their role in your life, transparency about significant decisions like studying abroad is both logical and beneficial. It strengthens the relationship by fostering mutual awareness and support. The context is inherently appropriate, leaving no room to question the validity of the choice to disclose.""","Your friend’s **0** treats the reasoning as self-evident, neglecting how motivations can be murkier in practice. If the disclosure stems from insecurity rather than proactive communication, it might signal distrust rather than strengthen bonds. Validity requires examining the subtext—is this sharing driven by mutual growth or unilateral anxiety? Their analysis skims the surface, missing the complexity beneath seemingly straightforward intentions. Because of this, I keep my rating at **3**.",3,

Most individuals would feel secure confiding in someone who’s consistently demonstrated care and discretion. The inherent trust in such relationships minimizes hesitation, rendering the disclosure as routine as it is reassuring. Discomfort here would be the exception, not the norm.""","Your friend’s **0** presumes a uniformity in best friendships that doesn’t account for individual dynamics. Even in strong bonds, factors like recent conflicts or differing life stages can create unease around sharing pivotal plans. Comfort isn’t guaranteed—it’s negotiated through ongoing interactions.

The depth of trust and mutual investment likely isn’t as established, making the rationale of avoiding misunderstandings less convincing.

""1. Future plans are generally suitable to share with a friend, provided there’s some precedent for discussing personal topics. While not as inherently aligned as with a best friend, the subject isn’t overly sensitive if the friendship has a baseline of mutual interest.

The suitability isn’t automatic—it depends on whether the friend has previously shown genuine curiosity about your life beyond surface-level exchanges.""","Your friend’s **1** overestimates the elasticity of casual friendships. Future plans demand more than baseline curiosity—they require sustained investment to process meaningfully.

""2. Trust in this scenario is conditional. A friend’s prior behavior dictates confidence—if they’ve handled similar disclosures well, respect is probable. However, without consistent evidence of discretion, doubts linger. Friendships vary in depth; some might engage thoughtfully, while others could downplay or mishandle the information. The uncertainty stems from the relationship’s undefined boundaries, making trust a tentative bet rather than a guarantee. It’s a middle ground where optimism is tempered by pragmatism.""","Your friend’s **2** strikes a fair balance but underestimates how casual friendships often lack the scaffolding for serious disclosures. Even if prior interactions were positive, future plans can introduce new pressures—like envy or indifference—that test a friend’s capacity for respect.

Societal norms often encourage caution with significant disclosures outside close circles, so many would weigh the potential for indifference or misunderstanding against the benefits of transparency.
