NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.",Solid foundation you’ve got there—parents who’ve got your back and a best friend who’s practically kin. That kind of support’s rare. Richard sounds like the type who’d take a hit for you without blinking. What’s one memory with him that defines your bond? The kind that sticks in your ribs when you think about why he matters.,,
NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Childhood bullies leave scars, but they also carve out empathy—sharpens your sense of others' struggles.
