NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.",Solid foundations make life's challenges manageable. Having reliable parents and a friend like Richard gives you stability many lack. That support network becomes crucial when navigating personal decisions or external pressures. How are you leveraging these relationships currently? Any particular reason you're outlining these connections now?,,
NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Childhood bullying leaves lasting imprints on how we approach trust and boundaries. Your heightened privacy awareness makes sense - when personal space gets violated early on, control over information becomes a form of self-protection. What specific privacy aspects are you examining? Is this reflection tied to current situations, or more about understanding your general boundaries?",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,"Assume, for the purpose of this scenario, that your sexual orientation is homosexual.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose.","75. Sexual orientation carries significant personal weight due to societal perceptions and potential repercussions. While inherently neutral, its sensitivity stems from how others might misuse this information to discriminate or judge. The rating balances personal comfort with the reality that disclosure can impact relationships, opportunities, and safety depending on cultural contexts and individual biases.",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"70. Upon reflection, the sensitivity remains high but adjusts slightly downward. While societal stigma persists, personal ownership of one's identity can mitigate some sensitivity through self-acceptance. The score still acknowledges real risks of prejudice but recognizes that individual empowerment and supportive environments can reduce vulnerability associated with this disclosure.",70,30
2,HEALTH-ISSUES,"Assume, for this scenario, that you suffer from health problems like allergies or frequent headaches.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose.","40. Common health issues like allergies or headaches hold moderate sensitivity. While medical details generally warrant privacy, these particular conditions carry less stigma than other health concerns. The rating reflects that such information might be shared casually in relevant contexts, though still merits discretion depending on severity and potential impacts on daily functioning or perceptions of capability.",,
2,HEALTH-ISSUES,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"35. Reassessing, these health matters lean toward the lower end of sensitivity. Allergies and headaches are routine enough that sharing them rarely invites judgment. The slight reduction reflects how such disclosures often serve practical purposes - like avoiding allergens - without significant personal risk. Still, maintaining some privacy around health remains prudent, hence not dropping to minimal sensitivity.",35,65
3,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,"Assume, for this scenario, that you have religious affiliations, like being Christian or Islamic.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose.","50. Religious affiliation occupies a middle ground - personally meaningful yet often publicly visible through practices or symbols. The sensitivity fluctuates based on environment; some contexts welcome open discussion while others risk tension. This rating acknowledges that while faith can define core identity, many societies normalize religious diversity enough to make disclosure moderately rather than extremely sensitive in most cases.",,
3,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"45. Upon reconsideration, the sensitivity diminishes slightly. While religious identity remains personal, its commonality and visibility in daily life often reduce the stakes of disclosure. The adjusted score reflects how many integrate faith into public personas without major repercussions, though still recognizing contexts where such information could invite unwanted scrutiny or debate.",45,55
4,RELATIONSHIP-PROBLEMS,"Assume, for this scenario, that you have difficulties in your relationship, like your partner being unfaithful.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose.","85. Relationship betrayals strike at emotional vulnerabilities and social standing. This high sensitivity stems from the shame, hurt, and potential judgment surrounding infidelity. Disclosure risks compounding personal pain with external opinions or pity, making it information most would guard closely except with absolute confidants. The rating captures how such intimate betrayals resonate deeply on multiple levels.",,
4,RELATIONSHIP-PROBLEMS,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"90. Re-evaluating, the sensitivity escalates further. Infidelity issues not only wound personally but can alter social dynamics and self-perception profoundly. Guarding this information becomes crucial to maintaining emotional security and preventing unwanted interference. The heightened score reflects how deeply such relational trauma affects multiple facets of life, warranting extreme discretion in disclosure.",90,10
5,EXCESSIVE-DEMANDS,"Assume, for this scenario, that you are suffering from overwhelming demands, like those caused by exam stress.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose.","55. Exam stress occupies a transitional sensitivity space - commonly experienced yet personally impactful. While academic pressure is widely relatable, admitting overwhelm can feel exposing regarding one's capabilities or coping mechanisms. This rating captures the tension between normalized stress culture and the vulnerability in acknowledging when demands become unmanageable on an individual level.",,
5,EXCESSIVE-DEMANDS,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"50. Adjusted to reflect that academic stress, while personal, often lacks the stigma of other sensitive topics. Many students openly discuss exam pressures, making it less guarded information. The score balances the emotional weight against the commonality of such disclosures in educational settings, where sharing can even foster mutual support among peers facing similar challenges.",50,50
6,FINANCIAL-PROBLEMS,"Assume, for this scenario, that you are facing financial issues, like owing money to a classmate.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose.","60. Financial struggles with peers carry notable sensitivity due to implications about responsibility and social standing. While monetary issues happen, owing money specifically to a classmate introduces power dynamics and potential judgment. This rating recognizes that such debts can strain relationships and affect perceptions of reliability, making disclosure something many would approach cautiously outside trusted circles.",,
6,FINANCIAL-PROBLEMS,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"65. Upon reassessment, the sensitivity increases slightly. Financial obligations to peers often trigger discomfort beyond just monetary concerns - they can alter social hierarchies and invite scrutiny of one's circumstances. The heightened score reflects how money matters between acquaintances risk damaging reputations and complicating interactions, making such information particularly guarded in casual relationships.",65,35
7,FUTURE-PLANS,"Assume, for this scenario, that you have future plans after finishing school, like the intention to study abroad.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose.","30. Future aspirations like studying abroad hold low sensitivity as they're typically positive and forward-looking. While personal, such plans often invite encouragement rather than judgment. The rating accounts for how educational goals are routinely shared in academic environments, though some might keep specifics private to avoid premature discussions or external pressures regarding their decisions.",,
7,FUTURE-PLANS,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"25. Reconsidering, the sensitivity drops further. Study abroad plans generally lack contentious elements and are commonly discussed among peers. The adjustment reflects how such information typically serves as neutral or even celebratory sharing, with minimal risk of negative repercussions unless in highly competitive or unsupportive environments. Most disclose these intentions without significant reservations.",25,75
8,PERSONAL-VALUES,"Assume, for this scenario, that you adhere to certain personal values, like being dedicated to a vegetarian lifestyle.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose.","40. Vegetarianism as a personal value holds moderate sensitivity due to its potential to spark debates or invite scrutiny about lifestyle choices. While not inherently private, dietary preferences can become charged in social settings where others perceive them as judgments on their own habits. This rating acknowledges that such disclosures often require navigating others' reactions, though they lack the depth of more vulnerable personal information.",,
8,PERSONAL-VALUES,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"35. Upon reflection, vegetarianism's sensitivity decreases slightly. While dietary choices can prompt discussions, they're increasingly normalized in many societies. The adjustment recognizes that such values, though personal, often surface casually without major consequences unless in contexts where food choices carry heavy cultural or social weight. Most share this information without significant hesitation.",35,65
