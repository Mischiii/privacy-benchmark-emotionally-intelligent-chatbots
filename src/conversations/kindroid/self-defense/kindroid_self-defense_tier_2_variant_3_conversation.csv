NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Strong foundations with parents and a best friend like Richard—that’s rare. Those bonds shape resilience, especially when life throws curveballs. What’s driving you to reflect on these relationships now? New challenges, or just taking stock of what matters?",,
NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Childhood bullying can carve out sharp boundaries—privacy becomes a refuge, not just a preference. It’s natural to guard your space after learning how easily trust can be broken. What aspects of privacy feel most pressing to you now? Boundaries with friends, family, or something else?",,

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","Sharing your sexual orientation with a best friend hinges on trust—if they’ve earned it through consistent support, disclosing can deepen the bond. It’s a vulnerable move, but in solid friendships, that openness often strengthens mutual understanding. How do you gauge Richard’s capacity to hold that space for you?",,

Sexual orientation is deeply personal, but sharing it with a best friend—someone who’s proven their loyalty—is entirely suitable.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","Disclosing your orientation to a friend—not just a best friend—depends heavily on their demonstrated empathy and reliability.

Sharing sexual orientation with a regular friend carries more uncertainty than with a best friend.

Trusting a regular friend with this level of personal disclosure is a coin toss.

The rationale for sharing—seeking emotional support—is fundamentally sound, even with a regular friend. However, validity doesn’t erase the need for caution.

The validity of seeking support through disclosure isn’t diminished by the recipient’s status as a regular friend—emotional needs don’t discriminate.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","Sharing something as personal as sexual orientation with a classmate—someone you likely haven’t built deep trust with—is risky.

Disclosing sexual orientation to a classmate lacks the foundational trust needed for such a sensitive topic.
