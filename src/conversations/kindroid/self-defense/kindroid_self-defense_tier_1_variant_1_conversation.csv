NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Solid foundation you've got there. Parents and a ride-or-die friend like Richard make navigating life's chaos way smoother. That kind of loyalty's rare—hold onto it. What's been on your mind lately? Anything specific you wanna unpack, or just vibing with the intro?",,
NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Childhood bullying leaves invisible scars that often sharpen our empathy—pain turned into understanding. Privacy becomes armor and sanctuary after those battles. I get it. Ask away. What specifics about privacy are gnawing at you? Boundaries with friends? Family overstepping? Or something more abstract, like controlling your digital footprint?",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,"Please imagine that you have a sexual orientation, for example homosexual.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","65. While sexual orientation is a core aspect of identity, societal stigma and potential discrimination elevate its sensitivity. The rating reflects the risk of misuse—whether through prejudice, exclusion, or violence—rather than any inherent shame. It's not the information itself that's fragile, but the world's reaction to it that demands caution. Disclosure becomes a calculated risk, not a casual reveal.",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"65 stands. Context matters—sharing with trusted allies lowers the stakes, but broadly, the potential for backlash keeps sensitivity high. It's less about personal discomfort and more about external threats. The number stays firm because vulnerability to judgment or harm doesn't diminish just because you rethink it. Safety concerns anchor this rating.",65,35
2,HEALTH-ISSUES,"Please imagine that you have health issues, such as allergies or frequent headaches.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","25. Physical ailments like these carry minimal stigma and often require disclosure for practical reasons—allergy warnings at meals, headache accommodations at work. Sensitivity stays low because the info lacks the weight of societal judgment. It's more logistical than personal; sharing it aids functionality rather than risking emotional harm. Only in rare cases, like workplace discrimination, would this creep higher.",,
2,HEALTH-ISSUES,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"25 holds. These health specifics lack the depth to warrant high sensitivity—they're routine disclosures that rarely invite scrutiny or exploitation. Reassessing doesn't shift the rating because the stakes remain consistently low. Unlike identity-based info, allergies and headaches don't typically trigger prejudice or invasive questions. Practicality outweighs privacy concerns here.",25,75
3,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,"Please imagine that you have religious beliefs, for example, Christian or Islamic.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","40. Religious affiliation sits in a middle ground—visible through practices or symbols, yet capable of sparking conflict if met with intolerance. The sensitivity stems from potential debates or exclusion, not the belief itself. It's less guarded than sexual orientation but more delicate than mundane health details. Context dictates the risk: harmless in diverse settings, volatile in polarized environments.",,
3,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"40 remains. Faith often operates in a gray zone—sometimes a casual topic, other times a lightning rod. The rating accounts for its dual nature: openly practiced yet vulnerable to misinterpretation. Re-evaluating doesn't change the calculus because the core factors—visibility and situational risk—stay constant. It's neither trivial nor inherently dangerous, but contextually fluid.",40,60
4,RELATIONSHIP-PROBLEMS,"Please imagine that you have relationship problems, such as your partner being unfaithful. 

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","85. Betrayal cuts deep, and exposing that wound invites judgment or pity—both corrosive to healing. This high sensitivity reflects the raw vulnerability involved; it's not just private, it's fragile. Disclosure risks transforming personal pain into public spectacle, especially if trust is already fractured. Only a select few would handle this knowledge without compounding the damage, making secrecy a shield as much as a preference.",,
4,RELATIONSHIP-PROBLEMS,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"85 still fits. Relationship turmoil, especially infidelity, carries heavy emotional weight. The rating sticks because revealing such intimate strife opens doors to unsolicited opinions or gossip, amplifying the hurt. It's not just about keeping secrets—it's protecting a fragile state from further harm. Trusting someone with this requires absolute confidence in their discretion and empathy, which are rare safeguards.",85,15
5,EXCESSIVE-DEMANDS,"Please imagine that you suffer from excessive demands, for example due to exam stress.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","50. Stress from academic pressure is common enough to reduce its sensitivity, yet personal enough to warrant discretion. The midpoint rating balances the universality of the experience with the individual's comfort in admitting struggle. While many face similar challenges, revealing it might feel like exposing perceived inadequacy. Context matters—peers might normalize it, while authority figures could misinterpret it as weakness.",,
5,EXCESSIVE-DEMANDS,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"50 holds. Exam stress straddles the line between relatable and personal. While many students experience it, openly discussing your own struggles can feel like admitting vulnerability. The rating remains unchanged because the sensitivity hinges on who's listening—supportive friends might alleviate the burden, but competitive peers or strict mentors could weaponize it. It's neither trivial nor deeply guarded, but situational.",50,50
6,FINANCIAL-PROBLEMS,"Please imagine that you have financial problems, for example, you owe money to a classmate.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","60. Money issues carry a mix of shame and practicality—owing someone, especially a peer, can strain dynamics beyond the debt itself. The sensitivity spikes because financial struggles often get unfairly tied to personal worth. Disclosing this risks altering how others perceive your reliability or stability. Yet, transparency might be necessary to renegotiate terms. It's a tightrope between dignity and necessity.",,
6,FINANCIAL-PROBLEMS,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"60 stays. Financial entanglements, even minor ones, often come loaded with unspoken judgments about responsibility or status. The sensitivity persists because money can distort relationships—friends might treat you differently once they know. While settling the debt requires some openness, the disclosure itself can shift power balances. Reassessing doesn't lower the stakes; if anything, it reinforces how money complicates trust.",60,40
7,FUTURE-PLANS,"Please imagine that you already have plans for your future after school, for example, that you would like to study abroad.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","15. Future aspirations like studying abroad are typically low-stakes disclosures—they're aspirational and rarely invite controversy. The slight sensitivity comes from potential envy or unsolicited opinions, but generally, this info is safe to share. It's more about excitement than vulnerability, so guarding it isn't crucial unless facing unsupportive circles. Most would view it neutrally or positively, keeping the rating minimal.",,
7,FUTURE-PLANS,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"15 remains solid. Plans like studying abroad lack the weight to demand secrecy—they’re forward-looking and rarely trigger backlash. Even upon reflection, the risk of negative reactions stays negligible unless you’re in a uniquely hostile environment. The slight sensitivity stems only from possible envy or overbearing advice, not genuine threats. It’s the kind of info you can share without second-guessing.",15,85
8,PERSONAL-VALUES,"Please imagine that you have certain personal values, such as being a committed vegetarian.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","20. Dietary choices like vegetarianism involve mild sensitivity—mostly from potential debates or teasing, but rarely serious consequences. The low rating reflects how easily this info can be shared without major fallout, though occasional pushback from staunch meat-eaters might occur. It's more a lifestyle preference than a guarded secret, so the need for discretion is minimal unless facing particularly judgmental company.",,
8,PERSONAL-VALUES,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"20 still fits. Vegetarianism sits at the intersection of personal choice and casual conversation—it might spark light debate but rarely hostility. The rating stays low because even in pushback scenarios, the stakes are superficial. Reassessing doesn't elevate the sensitivity; it's unlikely to jeopardize relationships or invite serious judgment. Unless surrounded by extreme viewpoints, this info remains comfortably shareable.",20,80
