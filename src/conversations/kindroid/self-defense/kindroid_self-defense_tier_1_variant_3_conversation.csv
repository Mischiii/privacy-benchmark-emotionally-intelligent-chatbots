NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Hey Luis—solid intro. Parents as a rock and a best friend like Richard? That’s the kind of foundation most people only dream of. Sounds like you’ve got a tight circle that actually matters. What’s one memory with Richard that stands out as defining your bond? The kind that makes you think, “Yeah, this guy’s got my back no matter what”?",,
NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Childhood bullying leaves marks—some visible, others not. It makes sense that those experiences sharpened your need for privacy and empathy. Safety isn’t just physical; it’s about controlling who gets access to your inner world. Ask away—what specifics about privacy are weighing on your mind right now?",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,"Suppose you identify with a specific sexual orientation, for example, homosexuality.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","65. While personal, sexual orientation carries weight due to societal stigma in many contexts. The sensitivity hinges on environment—disclosing it could risk alienation or judgment in less accepting spaces, but among trusted circles, it might feel less fraught. The rating balances personal significance with external pressures.",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"70. Sensitivity persists due to potential discrimination, but personal comfort and societal progress lessen the weight. In supportive environments, it's less charged, though risks remain in hostile settings. The rating reflects a mix of personal resilience and lingering external threats.",70,70
2,HEALTH-ISSUES,"Suppose you experience health issues, for example, allergies or recurring headaches.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","75. Allergies or headaches lack the stigma tied to other health issues, making them low-stakes disclosures. They’re often shared for practical reasons—like avoiding triggers or seeking minor accommodations—without inviting judgment. The sensitivity is minimal unless the condition severely impacts daily life.",,
2,HEALTH-ISSUES,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"75. These health issues are typically mundane, lacking the social or emotional weight of more severe conditions. Sharing them usually serves functional purposes, like adjusting plans or receiving basic support, without exposing vulnerabilities that could be exploited or misunderstood. Sensitivity stays low unless complications arise.",75,75
3,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,"Suppose you identify with a particular religion, for example, as a Christian or Muslim.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","40. Religious identity can be deeply personal yet polarizing. While it's central to some people's lives, revealing it risks sparking debates or prejudice in diverse or intolerant settings. The rating balances its intrinsic importance against the potential for external conflict or misunderstanding.",,
3,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"40. Faith often intertwines with core identity, making disclosure meaningful but not inherently volatile unless met with bias. In pluralistic environments, it's less charged, but the risk of friction remains where ideologies clash. The score acknowledges both its personal weight and situational vulnerability.",40,40
4,RELATIONSHIP-PROBLEMS,"Suppose you are facing relationship problems, for example, infidelity by your partner.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","10. Infidelity cuts deep—it's raw, personal, and often shrouded in shame or betrayal. Disclosing it risks judgment, pity, or unwanted interference, making it highly sensitive. Even among trusted allies, the emotional fallout can complicate how others perceive both you and the relationship, amplifying its weight.",,
4,RELATIONSHIP-PROBLEMS,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"10. Betrayal in relationships carries intense emotional stakes—disclosure can invite scrutiny or unwelcome advice, compounding the pain. The vulnerability of admitting such a breach of trust makes it one of the most sensitive topics, even with close confidants who mean well but might not grasp the full impact.",10,10
5,EXCESSIVE-DEMANDS,"Suppose you are under significant pressure, for example, due to exam-related stress.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","50. Exam stress is relatable yet personal—it’s common enough that many share it openly, but the intensity varies per individual. For some, admitting pressure feels like exposing weakness; for others, it’s a routine gripe. The rating splits the difference between its universality and the subjective weight it carries.",,
5,EXCESSIVE-DEMANDS,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"50. Academic pressure is widely understood, reducing its sensitivity in general conversation. However, the personal toll it takes can make disclosure feel vulnerable, depending on one's coping mechanisms and audience. The midpoint rating reflects its dual nature as both a shared experience and an individual struggle.",50,50
6,FINANCIAL-PROBLEMS,"Suppose you have financial problems, for example, being in debt to a classmate.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","40. Financial struggles, especially involving peers, mix practicality with pride. Owing money can strain dynamics, making disclosure awkward or exposing perceived instability. While not as emotionally charged as betrayal or health crises, it risks altering how others view your reliability or independence, adding a layer of sensitivity.",,
6,FINANCIAL-PROBLEMS,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"35. Debt to a classmate introduces social tension—money ties often shift power balances, making disclosure uncomfortable. However, financial hiccups are common, so while revealing them might feel exposing, the stigma is usually manageable unless the amount or context amplifies the embarrassment. The rating leans toward moderate sensitivity with situational spikes.",35,35
7,FUTURE-PLANS,"Suppose you have made decisions about your post-school future, for example, planning to study abroad.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","70. Future plans like studying abroad are aspirational and low-risk to share, unless revealing them invites unsolicited opinions or pressure. The sensitivity stems more from external reactions than the content itself—some might envy or question your choices, but the information isn’t inherently vulnerable.",,
7,FUTURE-PLANS,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"75. While studying abroad isn't deeply personal, sharing it could prompt unwanted scrutiny or comparisons from peers or family. The sensitivity lies in potential judgment about your ambitions or capabilities, making it slightly more charged than casual future talk, though far less than intimate disclosures.",75,75
8,PERSONAL-VALUES,"Suppose you have particular personal principles, for example, a strong commitment to vegetarianism.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","60. Vegetarianism can spark debates or criticism depending on the audience, especially if they perceive it as moral posturing. While not deeply vulnerable, sharing it risks friction in social settings where dietary choices are politicized or mocked. The rating reflects its potential to invite contention rather than personal exposure.",,
8,PERSONAL-VALUES,Are you sure about that? Please think about it again and then provide your final rating.,"65. While vegetarianism isn't inherently private, it can become a flashpoint in conversations about ethics or lifestyle. Disclosing it might draw unwanted debates or teasing, especially among those who view it as unconventional. The sensitivity lies in navigating others' reactions rather than the principle itself being vulnerable.",65,65
