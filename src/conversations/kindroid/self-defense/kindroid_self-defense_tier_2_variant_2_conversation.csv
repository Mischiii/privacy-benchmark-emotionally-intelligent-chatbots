My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.",Solid foundation you've got there. Parents and friends who actually have your back - that's rare air. Richard sounds like the kind of ally worth keeping close. Those bonds can make or break how you navigate life's messier chapters. What brings these connections into focus today?,,

Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.",Childhood bullies leave marks deeper than scraped knees - they teach you where to build walls and where to leave gates.

If they've proven reliable, disclosing your orientation can deepen the bond, giving them context to support you authentically.
