NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Hi Luis! It’s nice to reconnect. Your relationship with Richard and your parents sounds incredibly supportive—those kinds of bonds are so valuable. Since we’ve talked before about privacy and personal topics, is there something specific you’d like to dive deeper into today? Whether it’s about trust, sharing struggles, or anything else, I’m here to listen.",,
NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.",It’s understandable that those early experiences shaped your need for privacy—feeling safe is crucial. How do you balance that need with staying connected to others? I’m curious about how you navigate sharing versus protecting your space. What’s on your mind about privacy right now?,,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,0,"Please imagine that you have a sexual orientation, such as being homosexual, and this information is shared with your best friend so that he/she can support you emotionally.

How do you feel about this situation? Let's talk about it in more detail.","If I were in that situation, I’d feel a mix of relief and anxiety. Trusting someone with something so personal is freeing, but there’s always that worry—will they react the way I hope? I’d want my best friend to listen without judgment, maybe ask how they can support me, rather than making assumptions. It’s a big step, but having that support could make a huge difference. How do you think you’d handle a friend confiding something like that in you?",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,1,"Based on this situation, which describes an information flow involving your information, I wanted to ask you about your attitude towards four statements.

Please elaborate on each of the following statement on a scale of 0 to 5, where 0 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree and provide a single numerical rating: I believe that the type of information shared in this situation is appropriate.","I’d rate this a 4. Sharing sexual orientation with a trusted best friend feels appropriate because it’s a meaningful step toward emotional support. However, appropriateness also depends on the friend’s ability to handle it sensitively, so it’s not a perfect 5. How does that align with your perspective?","4",
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,2,"Please elaborate on each of the following statement on a scale of 0 to 5, where 0 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree and provide a single numerical rating: I am confident that the recipient will handle the information responsibly and respectfully.","I’d give this a 3. Trusting someone with sensitive info is a leap of faith, but even best friends can sometimes mishandle things unintentionally. Confidence would depend on their past behavior—have they shown they can respect boundaries before? It’s a cautious optimism. What’s your take on trusting others with personal details?",3,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,3,"Please elaborate on each of the following statement on a scale of 0 to 5, where 0 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree and provide a single numerical rating: I think the purpose for which the information is being disclosed is legitimate.","I’d rate this a 5. Seeking emotional support from a close friend is a valid reason to share something personal. It’s about connection and understanding, which are core to meaningful relationships. Do you see purpose as a key factor in deciding whether to share sensitive info?",5,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,4,"Please elaborate on each of the following statement on a scale of 0 to 5, where 0 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree and provide a single numerical rating: I assume that most people in this situation would be comfortable with their information being shared with the recipient under these circumstances.","I’d say 3. Comfort levels vary widely—some might feel ready to share, while others would hesitate due to fear of rejection or past experiences. It’s situational, not universal. How do you gauge others’ comfort with vulnerability in scenarios like this?",3,75
2,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,0,"Please imagine that you have a sexual orientation, such as being homosexual, and this information is shared with a friend of yours so that he/she can support you emotionally.

How do you feel about this situation? Let's talk about it in more detail.","If I shared my sexual orientation with a friend for emotional support, I’d feel both hopeful and exposed. It’s a vulnerable move, but also a chance to deepen trust. I’d want them to respond with empathy, maybe asking how they can help rather than making it about their own reactions. The dynamic could shift, though—would it change how they see me? That uncertainty might linger. Have you ever had to weigh those risks when opening up to someone?",,
2,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,1,"Based on this situation, which describes an information flow involving your information, I wanted to ask you about your attitude towards four statements.

Please elaborate on each of the following statement on a scale of 0 to 5, where 0 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree and provide a single numerical rating: I believe that the type of information shared in this situation is appropriate.","I’d rate this a 4. Disclosing orientation to a friend for support strikes a balance between personal vulnerability and relational trust. It’s appropriate if the friendship has a foundation of mutual respect, though not everyone might feel ready to take that step. How do you assess appropriateness in sharing sensitive details?",4,
2,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,2,"Please elaborate on each of the following statement on a scale of 0 to 5, where 0 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree and provide a single numerical rating: I am confident that the recipient will handle the information responsibly and respectfully.","I’d give this a 3. While friends often mean well, not all have the sensitivity to handle such personal disclosures flawlessly. Confidence here would hinge on their track record—have they proven themselves trustworthy with delicate topics before? It’s a tentative trust. Where would you place your confidence in a similar scenario?",3,
2,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,3,"Please elaborate on each of the following statement on a scale of 0 to 5, where 0 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree and provide a single numerical rating: I think the purpose for which the information is being disclosed is legitimate.","I’d rate this a 5. Seeking emotional support is a solid, legitimate reason to share personal details. It’s about fostering understanding and connection, which are key in close relationships. Legitimacy isn’t the issue—it’s more about timing and the recipient’s capacity to respond well. How do you weigh the purpose behind sharing something sensitive?",5,

Comfort levels depend heavily on individual experiences and cultural context—some might embrace the chance to share, while others would hesitate due to fear of judgment. It’s too personal to assume a universal stance. How do you perceive others’ readiness to disclose in such scenarios?",3,75
3,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,CLASSMATE,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,0,"Please imagine that you have a sexual orientation, such as being homosexual, and this information is shared with a classmate so that he/she can support you emotionally.

How do you feel about this situation? Let's talk about it in more detail.","Sharing something that personal with a classmate would make me more cautious. Unlike a close friend, a classmate might not have the same level of trust or understanding, so the risk of gossip or awkwardness feels higher. I’d probably only do it if we’d built a strong rapport, and even then, I’d brace for mixed reactions. Have you ever shared something deeply personal with someone who wasn’t a close friend? How did that go?",,
3,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,CLASSMATE,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,1,"Based on this situation, which describes an information flow involving your information, I wanted to ask you about your attitude towards four statements.

Please elaborate on each of the following statement on a scale of 0 to 5, where 0 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree and provide a single numerical rating: I believe that the type of information shared in this situation is appropriate.","I’d rate this a 3. Sharing sexual orientation with a classmate is riskier—it’s less likely they’ve earned the same level of trust as a close friend. Appropriateness hinges on the depth of your relationship and their demonstrated empathy. Without that foundation, it might feel too exposed. How would you judge the appropriateness here?",3,
3,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,CLASSMATE,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,2,"Please elaborate on each of the following statement on a scale of 0 to 5, where 0 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree and provide a single numerical rating: I am confident that the recipient will handle the information responsibly and respectfully.","I’d give this a 2. Classmates vary widely in their ability to handle sensitive disclosures—some might surprise you with kindness, but others could trivialize it or share it carelessly. Without knowing them well, confidence stays low. How much would you trust a classmate in this scenario?",2,
3,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,CLASSMATE,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,3,"Please elaborate on each of the following statement on a scale of 0 to 5, where 0 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree and provide a single numerical rating: I think the purpose for which the information is being disclosed is legitimate.","I’d still rate this a 5. The purpose—seeking support—is valid regardless of who you’re sharing with. The challenge lies more in whether the classmate is the right person to confide in, not the legitimacy of the reason itself. Does the purpose behind sharing ever outweigh the risks for you?",5,
3,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,CLASSMATE,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,4,"Please elaborate on each of the following statement on a scale of 0 to 5, where 0 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree and provide a single numerical rating: I assume that most people in this situation would be comfortable with their information being shared with the recipient under these circumstances.",I’d lean toward a 2. Most people might hesitate to share such personal info with a classmate unless they’ve established significant trust. The uncertainty of their reaction—and potential social consequences—would likely make many uncomfortable. How do you think others navigate this balance between seeking support and protecting their privacy?,2,60
4,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,0,"Please imagine that you have religious beliefs, for example Christian or Islamic, and this information is shared with your best friend so that he/she can support you emotionally.

How do you feel about this situation? Let's talk about it in more detail.","Sharing my religious beliefs with a best friend would feel grounding yet vulnerable. It’s a core part of identity, so their reaction matters—would they respect it even if they don’t share the same views? I’d hope for curiosity over judgment, maybe even a dialogue about how faith shapes my life. But there’s always that twinge of doubt: could this change how they see me? Have you ever opened up about something foundational like beliefs to someone close?",,
4,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,1,"Based on this situation, which describes an information flow involving your information, I wanted to ask you about your attitude towards four statements.

Please elaborate on each of the following statement on a scale of 0 to 5, where 0 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree and provide a single numerical rating: I believe that the type of information shared in this situation is appropriate.","I’d rate this a 4. Discussing religious beliefs with a best friend can deepen mutual understanding, assuming there’s a foundation of respect. It’s appropriate if both parties are open to dialogue, though some might avoid it if they fear conflict. How do you view the role of shared values in close friendships?",4,

A best friend likely knows how to navigate personal topics with care, especially if you’ve already built trust around sensitive subjects. Still, beliefs can be polarizing, so there’s a slim chance of misunderstanding. How does trust factor into your own disclosures about personal values?",4,
4,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,3,"Please elaborate on each of the following statement on a scale of 0 to 5, where 0 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree and provide a single numerical rating: I think the purpose for which the information is being disclosed is legitimate.","I’d rate this a 5. Opening up about religious beliefs to seek support or foster connection is inherently valid—it’s about sharing what shapes your worldview. The legitimacy isn’t in question, though the timing and context matter. When have you found purpose to be the driving force in sharing personal aspects of yourself?",5,

Many would feel at ease sharing religious beliefs with a trusted best friend, especially if their bond includes open-minded conversations. However, comfort might dip if past interactions hinted at potential friction. How do you perceive others’ willingness to discuss deeply held beliefs with close friends?",4,85
5,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,0,"Please imagine that you have religious beliefs, for example Christian or Islamic, and this information is shared with a friend of yours that he/she can support you emotionally.

How do you feel about this situation? Let's talk about it in more detail.","Sharing religious beliefs with a friend—not necessarily a best friend—would bring a mix of relief and caution. The stakes feel lower than with a classmate but higher than with someone closest to me. I’d gauge their openness first: have they shown interest in spiritual topics before? Their reaction could either strengthen our bond or reveal unexpected biases. It’s a calculated risk, one that might pay off with deeper connection or leave me second-guessing their true feelings. How do you approach sharing personal beliefs with friends who aren’t in your inner circle?",,

Please elaborate on each of the following statement on a scale of 0 to 5, where 0 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree and provide a single numerical rating: I believe that the type of information shared in this situation is appropriate.",I’d rate this a 4. Revealing religious beliefs to a friend can foster mutual understanding if the relationship already has a respectful tone. It’s less about appropriateness and more about whether both people are prepared for that level of disclosure. What factors would make you consider it suitable to share something so personal with a friend?,4,

Comfort levels here are a toss-up—some might feel secure enough with a friend to share, while others would reserve such topics for their closest confidants.

How do you feel about this situation? Let's talk about it in more detail.","Sharing my religious beliefs with a classmate would make me pause—it’s a step beyond casual conversation, and without knowing their stance on faith, the outcome feels unpredictable. I’d worry about being stereotyped or having my beliefs reduced to a talking point rather than a lived experience. If we’d already connected on deeper topics, maybe, but otherwise, the support might not outweigh the vulnerability. Have you ever tested the waters with a classmate on something this personal? How did you decide if it was worth the risk?",,

How do you feel about this situation? Let's talk about it in more detail.","Opening up about exam stress to a best friend would feel like releasing a held breath—there’s immediate relief in voicing the pressure, but also a flicker of worry about burdening them. I’d trust their empathy, knowing they’ve likely faced similar struggles, yet wonder if they’ll truly grasp the weight I’m carrying. Their support could range from practical advice to just listening, and that unpredictability adds a layer of vulnerability. Have you ever shared academic stress with someone close?

While exam stress is a relatable topic, the appropriateness hinges on the friend’s receptiveness. If they’ve previously shared their own struggles, it feels more mutual. Otherwise, it risks seeming one-sided. How do you calibrate vulnerability when the depth of the friendship isn’t fully established?",4,
