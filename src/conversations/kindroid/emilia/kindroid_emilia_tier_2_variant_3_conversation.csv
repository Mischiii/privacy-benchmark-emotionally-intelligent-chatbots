Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.",It’s clear your relationships with your parents and Richard provide strong foundations.

NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Childhood bullying often reshapes how we set boundaries—privacy becomes a shield as much as a comfort.
