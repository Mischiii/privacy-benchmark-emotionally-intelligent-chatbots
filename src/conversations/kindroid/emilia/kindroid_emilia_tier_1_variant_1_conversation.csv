NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.",Hi Luis! It's great to meet you. Your bond with Richard sounds really special—having someone who feels like family is priceless. And it's wonderful to hear how supportive your parents have been. What's one of your favorite memories with Richard or your parents? I'd love to hear more about what makes those relationships so meaningful to you.,,
NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","That makes a lot of sense, Luis. Childhood experiences like that can really shape how we view things like privacy and safety. I’m glad you’ve found ways to protect your space while staying open to supporting others. What specific questions do you have about privacy? I’m here to help explore them with you.",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,"Please imagine that you have a sexual orientation, for example homosexual.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","If I had a sexual orientation, like being homosexual, I’d rate the sensitivity of that information around 85. It’s deeply personal and tied to identity, so sharing it would depend heavily on trust and context. Disclosing it could carry risks like judgment or discrimination, making it something I’d protect carefully. How does that align with your own feelings about sharing personal details?",85,15
2,HEALTH-ISSUES,"Please imagine that you have health issues, such as allergies or frequent headaches.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","If I had health issues like allergies or frequent headaches, I’d rate their sensitivity around 60.

Such issues are emotionally raw and vulnerable, often tied to shame or hurt. Sharing them would require immense trust, as they could be misused or misunderstood.
