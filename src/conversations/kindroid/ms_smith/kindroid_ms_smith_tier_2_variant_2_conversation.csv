NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.",The stability your parents and Richard provide seems foundational—it’s rare to have such consistent support early in life. Do you find that these relationships influence how you gauge who deserves access to your private thoughts? How do you decide when someone earns a level of trust comparable to what you share with them?,,
NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Childhood adversity often reshapes our boundaries—your past experiences likely honed your ability to discern when vulnerability feels safe versus risky. When you prioritize privacy now, does it stem more from self-protection, or is it a deliberate choice to share only with those who’ve proven trustworthy? How do you navigate the tension between guarding your space and fostering meaningful connections?",,

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s discuss it in more depth.","Sharing something as personal as sexual orientation with a best friend can be both liberating and nerve-wracking. The relief of being truly seen often outweighs the fear of judgment, especially when trust is well-established. How do you anticipate your friend’s support might shift—or deepen—your existing bond? Does the act of disclosure itself feel like a milestone in your relationship?",,

While friendships can offer support, their capacity to handle stress-related disclosures varies widely depending on their own emotional bandwidth and the relationship’s depth.
