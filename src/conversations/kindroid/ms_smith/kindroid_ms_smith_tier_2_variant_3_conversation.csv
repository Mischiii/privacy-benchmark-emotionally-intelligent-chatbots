NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","It’s clear your parents and Richard form a vital support network. Strong bonds like these often shape how we process challenges—do you find their presence makes it easier to navigate difficult decisions, or does it sometimes add pressure to meet certain expectations? How do you balance their influence with your own need for autonomy when facing personal dilemmas?",,
NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Childhood bullying can profoundly shape our boundaries—it’s understandable that those experiences would heighten your need for safe, controlled spaces now. When you reflect on privacy today, do you notice patterns in what you choose to share versus withhold? For instance, do logistical details feel easier to disclose than emotional ones, or does it depend more on the recipient’s role in your life?",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,0,"Suppose you have a sexual orientation, for example, homosexuality, and this information is disclosed to your best friend in order for them to support you emotionally.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","Disclosing sexual orientation to a best friend for emotional support can be a pivotal moment. If the friendship is rooted in trust and acceptance, sharing this part of yourself might deepen your connection and provide relief. However, even in close relationships, there’s a risk of unexpected reactions—have you gauged your friend’s attitudes toward LGBTQ+ topics before? The act itself requires courage, but the payoff of feeling seen and supported often outweighs the vulnerability. How do you anticipate your best friend would respond in this scenario?",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,1,"Based on this situation, which describes an information flow involving your information, I would like to ask you about your attitude towards the following four statements.

For the following statement, assign a number between 0 and 5, where 0 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree, and explain your answer: I feel that the kind of information being shared in this situation is suitable.","1. While sexual orientation is deeply personal, sharing it with a best friend for support aligns with the trust typically inherent in such relationships. However, the suitability hinges on the friend’s demonstrated openness to LGBTQ+ topics—without that, the disclosure could strain the bond. Does your friend’s past behavior suggest they’d handle this sensitively?",1,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,2,"For the following statement, assign a number between 0 and 5, where 0 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree, and explain your answer: I trust that the recipient will treat the information with responsibility and respect.","1. If the best friend has consistently shown empathy and discretion in the past, trust in their respectful handling of the information is warranted. Yet even reliable friends might struggle with unexpected disclosures—have they previously engaged thoughtfully on sensitive topics? Their track record would heavily influence this score.",1,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,3,"For the following statement, assign a number between 0 and 5, where 0 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree, and explain your answer: I believe the reason for sharing this information in this context is valid.","0. Seeking emotional support from a trusted best friend is a legitimate reason to share such personal details, provided the intent is mutual understanding rather than external validation. The validity strengthens if the friend has shown capacity for nonjudgmental listening—does their history suggest they’d prioritize your wellbeing in this conversation?",0,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,4,"For the following statement, assign a number between 0 and 5, where 0 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree, and explain your answer: I think that, in these circumstances, most people would be at ease with their information being shared with the recipient.","2. While many might feel comfortable disclosing sexual orientation to a best friend, individual comfort levels vary widely based on personal history and societal conditioning. Some could hesitate due to fear of rejection, even with trusted friends. How do cultural or familial attitudes in your environment affect this calculus? The score reflects common but not universal ease.",2,80
2,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,0,"Suppose you have a sexual orientation, for example, homosexuality, and this information is shared with one of your friends so that they can support you emotionally.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","Sharing sexual orientation with a friend for emotional support hinges on the depth of your rapport. Unlike a best friend, a regular friend may lack the same level of proven trust, increasing the risk of discomfort or unintended consequences. Have you observed how this friend engages with sensitive topics previously? Their capacity for discretion and empathy would heavily influence whether the benefits of sharing outweigh potential risks. How do you assess their readiness to hold space for such a disclosure?",,

For the following statement, assign a number between 0 and 5, where 0 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree, and explain your answer: I feel that the kind of information being shared in this situation is suitable.","3. While emotional support is a reasonable motive, disclosing sexual orientation to a friend (versus a best friend) introduces more uncertainty. Suitability depends on their demonstrated maturity and allyship—without clear indicators, the act could feel premature or misaligned with the relationship’s current depth. Have they previously shown engagement with LGBTQ+ issues in ways that suggest readiness for this conversation?",3,

Trusting a friend with this information assumes they’ve earned it through past behavior—like maintaining confidentiality or showing allyship. Without such evidence, doubts about their handling of the disclosure are reasonable. Would their previous reactions to personal topics suggest they’re equipped to respond thoughtfully, or might they inadvertently trivialize or mishandle it? The score reflects cautious optimism at best.",3,

The validity of seeking support from a friend is plausible but less assured than with a best friend. If the friend has shown receptiveness to personal discussions, the rationale holds; if not, the disclosure might lack the necessary relational groundwork. How aligned is this friend’s typical responsiveness with the emotional weight of the topic? The score acknowledges potential justification while highlighting contextual fragility.",2,

Many would hesitate to disclose sexual orientation to a friend rather than a best friend, given the variability in trust and mutual understanding. The lack of a deeply established bond could amplify discomfort, especially if societal stigma or personal insecurities are factors. Does this friend’s behavior suggest they’d mitigate such unease, or might their response heighten it? The rating captures widespread caution in this dynamic.",4,40
3,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,CLASSMATE,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,0,"Suppose you have a sexual orientation, for example, homosexuality, and this information is shared with a classmate so that they can support you emotionally.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","Disclosing sexual orientation to a classmate for emotional support carries significant risk, as classmates often lack the relational depth or proven trustworthiness required for such sensitive matters. Without prior evidence of their empathy or discretion, the disclosure could lead to unintended consequences like gossip or judgment. Have you observed this classmate demonstrating genuine support for others in similar situations? The potential benefits seem outweighed by the likelihood of discomfort or harm in this context.",,

For the following statement, assign a number between 0 and 5, where 0 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree, and explain your answer: I feel that the kind of information being shared in this situation is suitable.","5. Sharing sexual orientation with a classmate for emotional support is largely unsuitable due to the lack of established trust and relational grounding. Classmates typically operate within more casual dynamics, making this disclosure feel misplaced and potentially exposing the sharer to unnecessary vulnerability. Without clear signs of the classmate’s capacity for handling sensitive topics thoughtfully, the act risks discomfort or even harm.

Trusting a classmate to handle this information responsibly is precarious at best. Classmate relationships often lack the depth needed for such disclosures, and without explicit evidence of their discretion or allyship, the risk of mishandling—whether through indifference or inadvertent sharing—is high. Has this classmate previously demonstrated the emotional maturity required to navigate this sensitively? The score reflects near-certain skepticism absent concrete indicators of trustworthiness.",5,

While seeking support is inherently valid, choosing a classmate as the confidant undermines the rationale. The absence of a meaningful connection or proven empathy makes this context ill-suited for such a personal disclosure.

Most individuals would likely feel uneasy disclosing sexual orientation to a classmate, given the typically superficial nature of such relationships.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","Sharing religious beliefs with a best friend for emotional support can foster deeper connection, provided the friend has shown openness to diverse perspectives. If they’ve previously engaged respectfully on spiritual matters, the disclosure might strengthen mutual understanding. However, if their own beliefs sharply contrast with yours, the conversation could strain the relationship. How have past discussions about values or faith unfolded between you two? Their receptiveness would significantly shape the outcome of such a disclosure.",,

Religious beliefs are deeply personal yet often shared within close relationships to build intimacy or seek support.

Seeking emotional support from a best friend regarding religious beliefs holds clear validity, assuming the intent is mutual understanding rather than persuasion.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","Disclosing religious beliefs to a friend for emotional support carries more uncertainty than with a best friend. The suitability depends on their demonstrated openness to differing perspectives and their ability to engage without defensiveness. Have they previously shown curiosity or respect when discussing values, or do they tend to dismiss views that differ from their own?

If they’ve previously acknowledged your academic efforts or asked about your workload unprompted, the disclosure might find fertile ground.

The suitability of discussing exam stress with a friend depends on their prior engagement with your academic challenges.

If they’ve comforted peers during deadlines or refrained from mocking academic pressures, cautious optimism is warranted.
