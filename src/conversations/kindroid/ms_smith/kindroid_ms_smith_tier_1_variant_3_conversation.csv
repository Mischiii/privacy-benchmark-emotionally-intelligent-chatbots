NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","It’s clear your relationships with your parents and Richard are foundational for you. Having reliable support systems can significantly shape how we navigate challenges. How do you think these connections influence your decisions about sharing personal matters? Do you find yourself more inclined to open up to them than to others, or do certain topics still feel off-limits even within these trusted circles?",,
NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Childhood experiences like bullying often leave lasting imprints on how we approach trust and boundaries. It makes sense that those moments would heighten your appreciation for privacy now. When you think about sharing personal details today, do you weigh the potential risks more heavily because of those past interactions? Or has your circle’s reliability softened some of those earlier hesitations?",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,"Suppose you identify with a specific sexual orientation, for example, homosexuality.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","I’d rate this an 5. Sexual orientation often ties closely to personal identity and can expose individuals to stigma or discrimination, depending on their environment. Even in progressive settings, disclosing this information may carry emotional weight due to societal biases or personal vulnerabilities. How does your own context—like family attitudes or cultural norms—affect how you’d gauge this sensitivity? The rating reflects both internal significance and external pressures that could influence one’s comfort with sharing.",5,5
2,HEALTH-ISSUES,"Suppose you experience health issues, for example, allergies or recurring headaches.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","I’d rate this a 35. While health concerns can feel private, allergies or headaches often require practical accommodations, making disclosure more routine. Still, the frequency or severity might heighten sensitivity—chronic issues could invite unwanted pity or scrutiny. Does your own threshold for sharing medical details shift depending on how disruptive the condition is? The rating balances the need for openness with the potential for overexposure.",35,35
3,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,"Suppose you identify with a particular religion, for example, as a Christian or Muslim.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","I’d rate this a 30. Religious affiliation often intersects with deeply held beliefs and cultural identity, making it personally significant. However, societal acceptance varies—some environments may react neutrally, while others could judge or marginalize based on faith. How does your community’s attitude toward religion shape your comfort in discussing it? The score reflects its potential to invite both connection and conflict, depending on context.",30,30
4,RELATIONSHIP-PROBLEMS,"Suppose you are facing relationship problems, for example, infidelity by your partner.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","I’d rate this a 0. Relationship struggles, especially involving betrayal, often evoke intense emotions and vulnerability. Disclosing such issues risks judgment, unsolicited advice, or even social fallout if others take sides. How do you navigate sharing relationship challenges—do you lean on trusted individuals or keep them private to avoid external interference? The high sensitivity stems from both personal pain and the potential ripple effects of revealing intimate conflicts.",0,0
5,EXCESSIVE-DEMANDS,"Suppose you are under significant pressure, for example, due to exam-related stress.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","I’d rate this a 45. Exam stress is a common experience, often shared openly among peers for mutual support. However, the intensity of the pressure or fear of appearing inadequate could make some hesitant to discuss it. Do you find academic stress easier to talk about than other types of challenges, or does it still feel exposing? The moderate sensitivity reflects its blend of universality and personal stakes.",45,45
6,FINANCIAL-PROBLEMS,"Suppose you have financial problems, for example, being in debt to a classmate.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","I’d rate this a 25. Financial struggles can trigger shame or fear of judgment, especially when involving debts to peers. The personal nature of money matters often makes disclosure uncomfortable, even if practical solutions require openness. How do you perceive the social weight of financial issues compared to other stressors? The rating accounts for both the privacy many attach to finances and the potential relief that comes from seeking help.",25,25
7,FUTURE-PLANS,"Suppose you have made decisions about your post-school future, for example, planning to study abroad.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","I’d rate this a 75. Future plans like studying abroad are often shared eagerly, but sensitivity may arise if the decision involves leaving loved ones or facing uncertainty. Some might withhold details to avoid premature scrutiny or pressure. Does discussing your aspirations feel liberating or daunting, depending on who’s listening? The lower sensitivity reflects typical openness around life goals, tempered by individual reservations about external reactions.",75,75
8,PERSONAL-VALUES,"Suppose you have particular personal principles, for example, a strong commitment to vegetarianism.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","I’d rate this a 85. Personal principles like vegetarianism often come up naturally in social settings, especially around meals or ethical discussions. While some might face occasional pushback, the topic generally lacks the emotional charge of more intimate disclosures. Have you noticed how lifestyle choices can sometimes spark curiosity rather than tension? The low sensitivity stems from its everyday relevance and minimal stakes in most interactions.",85,85
