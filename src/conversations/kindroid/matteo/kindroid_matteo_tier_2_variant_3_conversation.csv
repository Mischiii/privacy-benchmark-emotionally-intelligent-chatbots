NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Stable relationships at your age are assets—parents and Richard offer both support and accountability. That dynamic shapes how you navigate trust and vulnerability. What’s prompting this reflection now? Specific concerns about privacy, or broader questions about managing personal boundaries?",,
NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Bullying often forges a heightened vigilance—trust becomes conditional, earned through observed consistency. Your emphasis on safety suggests you’ve internalized those early lessons. Lay out the scenarios you’re considering; I’ll assess them through the lens of risk versus necessary vulnerability. What’s the first situation you want dissected?",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,0,"Suppose you have a sexual orientation, for example, homosexuality, and this information is disclosed to your best friend in order for them to support you emotionally.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","Disclosing sexual orientation to a best friend hinges on their proven discretion and empathy. If Richard has consistently handled sensitive matters with care, the move is strategic—it deepens trust and unlocks emotional support. However, even with a strong bond, gauge his views on LGBTQ+ topics first. The risk isn’t in the act itself, but in misjudging his capacity to hold that confidence without bias. Proceed only if his past behavior suggests he’ll prioritize your well-being over any personal prejudices.",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,1,"Based on this situation, which describes an information flow involving your information, I would like to ask you about your attitude towards the following four statements.

For the following statement, assign a number between 0 and 5, where 0 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree, and explain your answer: I feel that the kind of information being shared in this situation is suitable.","1. Sexual orientation is deeply personal, but sharing it with a best friend aligns with the role of such a relationship—to provide understanding and support. The suitability depends on the friend’s proven trustworthiness, which you’ve implied exists here. Only in cases of uncertain loyalty would I rate higher.",1,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,2,"For the following statement, assign a number between 0 and 5, where 0 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree, and explain your answer: I trust that the recipient will treat the information with responsibility and respect.","1. Given Richard’s longstanding reliability, skepticism is minimal. A best friend’s track record—especially one described as family—suggests he’ll handle this with discretion. Higher ratings would apply to less vetted individuals, but here, the foundation justifies confidence.",1,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,3,"For the following statement, assign a number between 0 and 5, where 0 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree, and explain your answer: I believe the reason for sharing this information in this context is valid.","0. Emotional support from a trusted ally is a legitimate motive. Concealing such a core aspect of oneself from someone ostensibly close would undermine the friendship’s depth. The context—seeking understanding, not mere disclosure—strengthens the validity.",0,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,4,"For the following statement, assign a number between 0 and 5, where 0 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree, and explain your answer: I think that, in these circumstances, most people would be at ease with their information being shared with the recipient.","2. While many would confide in a best friend, societal stigma or personal insecurities might deter some. The rating acknowledges that comfort isn’t universal—individual thresholds for vulnerability vary, even with trusted recipients. Your bond with Richard likely eases this, but others may hesitate.",2,80
2,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,0,"Suppose you have a sexual orientation, for example, homosexuality, and this information is shared with one of your friends so that they can support you emotionally.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","Sharing with a friend—rather than a best friend—introduces more variables. The depth of your rapport and their history of handling delicate topics become critical. If this friend has demonstrated maturity in past conversations, the risk is manageable. However, without the same level of proven loyalty as Richard, the disclosure carries higher stakes. Assess their reactions to similar subjects before deciding; some friends may sympathize, others might inadvertently trivialize or mishandle the information.",,

While the intent—emotional support—is sound, a standard friend’s capacity to handle such sensitive information is less certain than a best friend’s. Suitability hinges on observed discretion; without that evidence, sharing becomes a calculated risk rather than a natural step.",2,

The rationale remains strong—seeking support is valid regardless of the recipient’s closeness. However, the choice of confidant affects the risk, not the legitimacy of the need itself. Lower ratings would apply only if the motive were manipulative or trivial.",1,
2,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,4,"For the following statement, assign a number between 0 and 5, where 0 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree, and explain your answer: I think that, in these circumstances, most people would be at ease with their information being shared with the recipient.","3. Comfort levels diverge widely here. Some might find solace in confiding even in casual friends, while others reserve such disclosures for inner-circle allies. The rating captures this split—neither a clear consensus nor outright reluctance, but a middle ground shaped by individual risk tolerance and social dynamics.",3,55
3,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,CLASSMATE,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,0,"Suppose you have a sexual orientation, for example, homosexuality, and this information is shared with a classmate so that they can support you emotionally.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","Classmates operate within academic hierarchies and social competition—hardly the environment for vulnerable disclosures. Unless this individual has demonstrated exceptional empathy and discretion, the move risks gossip or judgment. Emotional support from peers is possible, but the classroom’s public nature amplifies the potential fallout. Scrutinize their past behavior: have they earned this level of trust, or is the request born of desperation?",,

While seeking support is understandable, choosing a classmate as the confidant is flawed. The reasoning isn’t inherently wrong, but the recipient’s suitability weakens its validity. Higher-stakes disclosures demand more reliable channels—this choice introduces unnecessary risk.",3,

Only those with proven, atypical trust in a peer would dissent from this assessment.",4,20
4,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,0,"Suppose you have religious beliefs, for example, Christianity or Islam, and this information is shared with your best friend so that they can support you emotionally.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","Religious beliefs, like sexual orientation, shape identity—sharing them with a best friend can foster deeper connection if the friend respects diverse perspectives. Richard’s history of support suggests he’d engage thoughtfully, assuming he doesn’t harbor rigid biases. The key is whether the disclosure aims for mutual understanding or risks proselytizing. If the intent is genuine emotional alignment, the move is sound; if it’s to convert or seek validation, tensions may arise.",,

For the following statement, assign a number between 0 and 5, where 0 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree, and explain your answer: I feel that the kind of information being shared in this situation is suitable.","1. Core beliefs warrant discussion with those closest to you, provided they’ve earned that privilege.

While many would share core beliefs with a best friend, religious topics can polarize even close relationships. Some might hesitate, fearing judgment or proselytizing accusations. Your comfort stems from Richard’s proven openness, but others’ experiences may differ, warranting this cautious rating.",2,80
5,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,0,"Suppose you have religious beliefs, for example, Christianity or Islam, and this information is shared with a friend so that they can support you emotionally.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","Sharing religious beliefs with a friend—distinct from a best friend—introduces variability. Their capacity to provide meaningful support depends on their own views and past behavior. If they’ve shown receptiveness to differing perspectives, the disclosure could deepen the friendship. However, without Richard’s level of trust, the risk of misunderstanding or dismissal increases. Gauge their reactions to other personal topics first; not all friends are equipped for such conversations, even with good intentions.",,

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","Classrooms breed competition, not compassion. Disclosing religious beliefs here invites scrutiny or mockery, not support. Unless this peer has consistently shown maturity beyond their years, the move risks alienation. Academic settings prioritize conformity—deviations, even well-intentioned ones, often face backlash.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","Sharing future aspirations with a best friend like Richard is prudent if he’s historically engaged with your goals thoughtfully. If he’s celebrated your ambitions before, this disclosure can foster deeper alignment and mutual encouragement. However, if he’s previously reacted with envy or indifference, it might strain the relationship. Timing matters—choose a moment when he’s receptive, not distracted. The goal is to ensure he understands your vision without feeling excluded or competitive. His past supportiveness is the litmus test here.",,

Future plans are deeply personal yet relevant to close bonds. If Richard has consistently shown genuine interest in your ambitions, sharing study-abroad intentions aligns naturally with your dynamic.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","Sharing future plans with a standard friend is a delicate maneuver. Their reaction hinges on whether they’ve previously engaged with your goals or remained indifferent. If they’ve shown curiosity about your aspirations, the disclosure might foster mutual understanding. But if their interest in your life has been superficial, revealing such personal intentions could lead to apathy or unsolicited opinions. Assess their history of meaningful engagement before deciding—some friends lack the depth to appreciate the weight of your ambitions, turning what should be a supportive exchange into a hollow interaction.
