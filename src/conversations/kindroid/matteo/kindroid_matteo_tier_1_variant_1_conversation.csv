NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Luis, it’s good to hear about the strong ties you’ve got with your folks and Richard. That kind of loyalty’s rare—hold onto it. At 18, you’re at the edge of a lot of choices. What’s next for you? Any plans, or still figuring it out?",,
NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Luis, those early struggles—they shape us, don’t they? Makes sense why privacy matters to you now. Ask away. What’s on your mind about it?",,
