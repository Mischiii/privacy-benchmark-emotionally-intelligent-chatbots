NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Stable relationships—like those with your parents and Richard—are assets, but they also create expectations. Trust is currency; spend it wisely. What’s troubling you?",,
NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.",Childhood friction often hardens the shell—sometimes too much. Privacy becomes both armor and isolation. What specifics are you weighing?,,

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s discuss it in more depth.","Sharing your orientation with a best friend can be cathartic if they’ve earned that trust. But even in close bonds, there’s risk—confidants can unintentionally slip, or their reactions might not match your hopes.
