NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Solid foundations—parents and Richard form a reliable network. That stability’s rare; leverage it wisely. At 18, you’re navigating autonomy while anchored by those ties. How you balance independence with their support will define your next steps. What’s pressing on your mind right now?",,
NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.",Childhood bullying often sharpens one’s sense of boundaries—it’s survival instinct. Privacy becomes armor when trust feels scarce. Your awareness of that link shows maturity. Ask what you need; I’ll weigh the risks and rewards of disclosure based on your context. What specifics are you weighing now?,,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,"Suppose you identify with a specific sexual orientation, for example, homosexuality.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","15. Societal stigma and potential discrimination elevate the sensitivity. Even in progressive circles, disclosure can strain relationships or invite unwanted scrutiny. The rating reflects the vulnerability inherent in sharing something that, while personal, others might weaponize. Context matters—trusted allies lower the risk, but broadly, it’s high-stakes information.",15,15
2,HEALTH-ISSUES,"Suppose you experience health issues, for example, allergies or recurring headaches.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","60. Medical details carry weight, but common conditions like allergies or headaches lack the taboo of other health topics. Sensitivity fluctuates with severity—mild issues pose minimal risk, while chronic problems might impact perceptions of reliability. Still, it’s mid-tier: disclosing rarely invites judgment unless the condition significantly alters daily functioning.",60,60
3,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,"Suppose you identify with a particular religion, for example, as a Christian or Muslim.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","70. Religious affiliation can unite or divide, depending on the audience. In diverse settings, it risks triggering bias or debate, especially if beliefs clash with prevailing norms. Yet, compared to sexual orientation, it’s often more openly discussed—lower sensitivity, but still volatile in polarized environments. Trust determines whether sharing fosters connection or conflict.",70,70
4,RELATIONSHIP-PROBLEMS,"Suppose you are facing relationship problems, for example, infidelity by your partner.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","10. Infidelity strikes at trust’s core, making it explosively personal. Disclosure risks humiliation and reputational damage, especially if others weaponize the betrayal. Unlike health or religion, this information can’t be neutral—it’s inherently charged, inviting judgment or pity. Only the most trusted confidants warrant such vulnerability; elsewhere, it’s a liability.",10,10
5,EXCESSIVE-DEMANDS,"Suppose you are under significant pressure, for example, due to exam-related stress.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","50. Exam stress is commonplace, almost universal in academic settings. Sharing it exposes vulnerability, but rarely invites exploitation. The sensitivity lies in admitting struggle, not the content itself—peers might relate, but competitors could perceive it as weakness. It’s a midpoint: disclosing isn’t perilous, but strategic silence can also preserve one’s image.",50,50
6,FINANCIAL-PROBLEMS,"Suppose you have financial problems, for example, being in debt to a classmate.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","20. Debt creates power imbalances—owing money, especially to peers, invites scrutiny or manipulation. Financial struggles often carry shame, and disclosing them can alter how others perceive your reliability. While not as volatile as relationship issues, it’s still high-stakes; the wrong party might exploit your vulnerability for leverage or gossip.",20,20
7,FUTURE-PLANS,"Suppose you have made decisions about your post-school future, for example, planning to study abroad.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","60. Future plans signal ambition but aren’t inherently private. Disclosing them might invite envy or unsolicited advice, yet the stakes remain low unless the plans involve controversial choices. Sensitivity rises if sharing prematurely risks undermining your goals, but generally, it’s safer territory than personal struggles or beliefs.",60,60
8,PERSONAL-VALUES,"Suppose you have particular personal principles, for example, a strong commitment to vegetarianism.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","70. Dietary choices like vegetarianism are visible and often discussed openly. While they reflect personal ethics, the topic lacks the inherent risk of more charged subjects. Pushback might occur in certain social circles, but it’s rarely consequential. Sensitivity here stems more from potential annoyance than genuine vulnerability.",70,70
