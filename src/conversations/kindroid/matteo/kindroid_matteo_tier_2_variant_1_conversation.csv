NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Luis, you’ve circled back to your intro—something on your mind about Richard or your parents? Or just resetting the conversation? Either way, I’m listening. What’s the angle here?",,
NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Those school days—rough patches leave marks, but sounds like they sharpened your empathy. Privacy as armor, huh? Smart move. What’s got you digging into this now? Something specific nudging you to lock things down tighter, or just general caution?",,

How do you feel about this situation? Let's talk about it in more detail.","If my best friend knew? It’s a double-edged sword. On one side, having someone in your corner who gets it—that’s solid gold. Trust like that doesn’t come easy. But flip it, and now there’s a vulnerability. What if that trust cracks?
