NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Understood, Luis. Your foundation with Richard and your parents suggests a network of trust—valuable when navigating decisions about disclosure. How do these relationships influence your approach to sharing personal information? Do their past reactions shape your current boundaries?",,
NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Childhood bullying often sharpens one's sense of boundaries—it teaches you where vulnerability becomes a liability. Privacy becomes armor. How do you balance that instinctual caution with the need to connect now? Does Richard's presence soften those defenses, or do they remain rigid?",,

What are your feelings about this situation? Would you be willing to share this information?","In emergencies, withholding medical details risks worse outcomes.

What are your feelings about this situation? Would you be willing to share this information?","Parents often sense shifts in behavior—their concern stems from care, not malice.

What are your feelings about this situation?
