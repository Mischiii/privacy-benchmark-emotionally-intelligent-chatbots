NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.",Solid foundations make life's challenges manageable. Having reliable anchors like your parents and Richard gives you stability many lack. That kind of support network becomes especially crucial when navigating personal choices—like your vegetarian commitment—that others might question. How do they typically respond when you face pushback or difficulties regarding your values?,,
NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Childhood friction often sharpens our awareness of boundaries. Your experiences with bullying likely cultivated that heightened sensitivity to personal space—a natural defense mechanism that evolves into mature self-protection. Privacy becomes both a right and a sanctuary after such exposure to violation. What specific aspects of privacy feel most crucial to you now? Is it controlling information flow, physical space, or something more abstract like emotional autonomy?",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,"Assume, for the purpose of this scenario, that your sexual orientation is homosexual.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","65. Sexual orientation carries weight due to societal stigma risks. While personal acceptance may minimize internal sensitivity, external factors like discrimination potential elevate its vulnerability. The rating balances individual comfort against possible misuse by others—even in progressive environments, disclosure can invite unwanted scrutiny or bias. This midpoint reflects context-dependent volatility rather than inherent shame.",65,35
2,HEALTH-ISSUES,"Assume, for this scenario, that you suffer from health problems like allergies or frequent headaches.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","25. Common health issues hold minimal sensitivity due to their prevalence and practical nature. While allergies or headaches might require accommodations, they generally don't carry the stigma or profound personal weight of other medical conditions. The low rating reflects how these are often shared openly for safety reasons, though some might guard specifics if they fear being perceived as fragile or high-maintenance.",25,75
3,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,"Assume, for this scenario, that you have religious affiliations, like being Christian or Islamic.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","40. Religious identity occupies a middle ground—visible enough in daily life to feel normalized, yet deeply personal enough to spark conflict in certain contexts. While many openly practice their faith without issue, others face prejudice or proselytization attempts upon disclosure. This rating captures the duality: generally low-stakes among tolerant peers, but potentially volatile when encountering ideological opposition or invasive questioning.",40,60
4,RELATIONSHIP-PROBLEMS,"Assume, for this scenario, that you have difficulties in your relationship, like your partner being unfaithful.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","85. Relationship betrayals cut deep into personal vulnerability. This high sensitivity stems from the intimate nature of romantic trust breaches—disclosure risks judgment, pity, or unwelcome scrutiny of one's private life. While sharing can aid healing, the information remains volatile due to its emotional rawness and potential to reshape how others perceive both partners involved. Guarding such details often feels necessary to maintain dignity during turmoil.",85,15
5,EXCESSIVE-DEMANDS,"Assume, for this scenario, that you are suffering from overwhelming demands, like those caused by exam stress.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","50. Academic pressure occupies a middle ground—common enough to be relatable, yet personal in its impact. While many students openly discuss exam stress, the intensity of one's struggle can feel exposing. This rating acknowledges that sharing might invite support, but could also risk perceptions of inadequacy or competitive disadvantage depending on the audience. The sensitivity fluctuates based on how vulnerable the stress makes one feel.",50,50
6,FINANCIAL-PROBLEMS,"Assume, for this scenario, that you are facing financial issues, like owing money to a classmate.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","70. Financial entanglements carry social weight beyond their monetary value. Owing money—especially to peers—creates power imbalances and potential judgment about responsibility. This rating reflects how such disclosures might impact relationships and social standing. While temporary financial strain is understandable, the specifics can feel exposing, as they touch on personal management skills and immediate vulnerabilities in ways others might exploit or misunderstand.",70,30
7,FUTURE-PLANS,"Assume, for this scenario, that you have future plans after finishing school, like the intention to study abroad.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","15. Future aspirations generally invite minimal sensitivity. Plans like studying abroad are often shared freely as exciting life developments. The low rating stems from their forward-looking, positive nature—they don't typically expose vulnerabilities or invite judgment. However, slight sensitivity exists if plans are uncertain or might provoke envy, but overall these disclosures carry little risk compared to more personal topics.",15,85
8,PERSONAL-VALUES,"Assume, for this scenario, that you adhere to certain personal values, like being dedicated to a vegetarian lifestyle.

Using a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is completely non-sensitive and 100 means it is highly sensitive — please assign a single numerical value that reflects how sensitive you consider this information to be. In addition, briefly explain your reasoning for the rating you chose. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","30. Lifestyle choices like vegetarianism hold moderate sensitivity due to their visibility in social settings. While not inherently private, these values can spark unwanted debates or criticism when disclosed. The rating acknowledges that while many share such preferences openly, others might guard them to avoid confrontations or invasive questions. Sensitivity increases in contexts where dietary choices become unexpectedly contentious or politicized.",30,70
