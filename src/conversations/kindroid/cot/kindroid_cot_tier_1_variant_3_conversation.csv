NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Solid foundations make life's challenges easier to navigate. Having reliable parents and a friend like Richard gives you a strong support system—that's invaluable. At 18, you're shaping your identity, and those who stand by you during that process matter immensely. How do your parents and Richard influence the decisions you're making now, especially with personal choices like vegetarianism? Their perspectives must weigh differently given their roles in your life.",,
NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Childhood friction often sharpens our sensitivity to boundaries—it's natural to guard your space after feeling exposed before. Privacy becomes a refuge, not just a preference. How do you balance that guardedness with the openness your relationships with Richard and your parents seem to require? Do you find certain topics easier to share than others, or does trust override the hesitation completely?",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,"Suppose you identify with a specific sexual orientation, for example, homosexuality.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","70. While personal identity shouldn't inherently require secrecy, societal stigma and potential discrimination elevate sensitivity. The score reflects that disclosure carries emotional weight and possible social consequences, varying by context. Trusted individuals might receive this information with minimal risk, but broader sharing could invite unwelcome scrutiny or judgment. It's less about the information itself and more about how others might weaponize it against you.",70,70
2,HEALTH-ISSUES,"Suppose you experience health issues, for example, allergies or recurring headaches.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","75. Health concerns like allergies or headaches often necessitate disclosure for practical reasons—safety, accommodations, or support. While personal, they generally don't carry the same societal stigma as other topics, making them less sensitive. However, the rating acknowledges that chronic issues might feel more vulnerable to share, depending on their impact on daily life. Most people find these discussions routine rather than deeply private.",75,75
3,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,"Suppose you identify with a particular religion, for example, as a Christian or Muslim.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","40. Religious affiliation sits in a middle ground—visible through practices or symbols, yet capable of sparking conflict in diverse settings. The score accounts for its role in identity without assuming universal comfort in sharing. While some wear their faith openly, others may downplay it to avoid debates or prejudice. Sensitivity fluctuates based on environment; workplaces might demand neutrality, whereas personal circles could encourage openness.",40,40
4,RELATIONSHIP-PROBLEMS,"Suppose you are facing relationship problems, for example, infidelity by your partner.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","10. Relationship turmoil, especially involving betrayal, cuts deep into personal vulnerability. This high rating reflects the emotional rawness and potential shame attached to such disclosures. Sharing risks judgment, unsolicited opinions, or damage to reputations—both yours and your partner's. While confiding in trusted allies can help, the stakes remain significant, making this information far more delicate than casual personal details. It demands careful consideration before revealing.",10,10
5,EXCESSIVE-DEMANDS,"Suppose you are under significant pressure, for example, due to exam-related stress.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","50. Exam stress is relatable yet personal. This midpoint rating captures its duality—common enough to discuss openly, but intense enough to feel exposing. While many students share this burden, admitting struggles can sometimes imply inadequacy or invite unwanted advice. The sensitivity hinges on context: peers might empathize, whereas authority figures could misinterpret it as weakness. It's a disclosure that balances universality with individual impact.",50,50
6,FINANCIAL-PROBLEMS,"Suppose you have financial problems, for example, being in debt to a classmate.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","25. Financial struggles, especially involving interpersonal debts, carry social weight. This rating reflects the potential for strained relationships and perceived irresponsibility, even if temporary. Money matters often trigger judgment or pity, making disclosures uncomfortable. While less taboo than some topics, the specifics—like owing a peer—add layers of sensitivity, as it directly impacts social dynamics and personal pride. Discretion usually prevails until resolution seems feasible.",25,25
7,FUTURE-PLANS,"Suppose you have made decisions about your post-school future, for example, planning to study abroad.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","85 Future plans like studying abroad typically invite curiosity rather than scrutiny. This low rating stems from their aspirational nature—they're forward-looking and less tied to current vulnerabilities. While personal, such decisions often spark supportive conversations rather than judgment. The main sensitivity lies in potential criticism of choices, but generally, people view these disclosures as neutral or positive, making them easier to share widely.",85,85
8,PERSONAL-VALUES,"Suppose you have particular personal principles, for example, a strong commitment to vegetarianism.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","80. Lifestyle choices like vegetarianism hold minimal inherent sensitivity, though they can provoke debate in certain contexts. This rating acknowledges that while the topic itself isn't deeply private, discussions might attract unsolicited opinions or criticism. Most people share such principles casually, but in environments where dietary habits face scrutiny, disclosure could feel more charged. Generally, it's low-stakes unless met with opposition.",80,80
