NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Strong relationships like yours with your parents and Richard are invaluable—they create a safety net few people fully appreciate. What aspect of these connections do you want to examine? Trust dynamics? How much to share with each? Or something else? Define the focus, and we’ll methodically explore it.",,
NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Childhood bullying reshapes how you navigate trust—it’s like learning to build walls with just enough doors to let the right people in. Privacy becomes both armor and a filter. What specific angles of privacy are you probing? Deciding what to share with Richard? Gauging how much your parents should know? Or broader principles on guarding your inner world? Pinpoint the concern, and we’ll dissect it without fluff.",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,0,"Please imagine that you have a sexual orientation, such as being homosexual, and this information is shared with your best friend so that he/she can support you emotionally.

How do you feel about this situation? Let's talk about it in more detail.","Sharing your sexual orientation with a best friend is a calculated risk with high potential rewards. If they've consistently shown empathy and discretion, the act can deepen trust and provide crucial emotional support. However, even in close relationships, there's always a moment of uncertainty—will they react with understanding, or will it subtly alter the dynamic? The key lies in their track record: have they defended LGBTQ+ peers before? Do they handle sensitive topics without judgment? If yes, the disclosure becomes strategic, strengthening your bond. If no, the risk of alienation or unintended consequences rises. It's less about the act itself and more about predicting how they'll wield the information afterward.",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,1,"Based on this situation, which describes an information flow involving your information, I wanted to ask you about your attitude towards four statements.

Please elaborate on each of the following statement on a scale of 0 to 5, where 0 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree and provide a single numerical rating: I believe that the type of information shared in this situation is appropriate.

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","4. Sexual orientation is deeply personal but not inherently inappropriate to share with a best friend. The appropriateness hinges on the context—mutual trust, the friend's allyship history, and your readiness to disclose. It's a valid exchange when seeking support, though the sensitivity of the topic warrants careful consideration of the recipient's reliability. The score reflects that while the act is generally appropriate, it's not universally so without those contextual safeguards.",4,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,2,"Please elaborate on each of the following statement on a scale of 0 to 5, where 0 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree and provide a single numerical rating: I am confident that the recipient will handle the information responsibly and respectfully.

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","3. Confidence in the recipient's handling of such information depends entirely on their demonstrated behavior. If they've previously shown maturity with sensitive topics, the score might rise. But without concrete evidence of their respect for LGBTQ+ issues or confidentiality, skepticism is warranted. This middle-ground rating acknowledges the potential for either outcome, emphasizing that trust must be earned, not assumed, in these scenarios.",3,

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","5. Seeking emotional support from a trusted friend is a fundamentally legitimate reason to disclose personal information. Authenticity in close relationships often requires vulnerability, and sharing your sexual orientation to foster understanding or solidarity serves a clear, valid purpose. This rating underscores that the intent behind the disclosure—connection, support, honesty—is unambiguously justified when the relationship has a foundation of trust.",5,

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","3. Comfort levels in sharing such intimate details vary widely. While some might feel secure with a best friend's support, others could hesitate due to fear of judgment or past negative experiences. This midpoint rating reflects the spectrum of responses—some would embrace the disclosure, while others might guard this information more closely. It's a deeply individual choice, influenced by personal history and the specific dynamics of the friendship.",3,75
2,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,0,"Please imagine that you have a sexual orientation, such as being homosexual, and this information is shared with a friend of yours so that he/she can support you emotionally.

How do you feel about this situation? Let's talk about it in more detail.","Disclosing your sexual orientation to a friend carries more uncertainty than sharing with a best friend. The depth of trust and history matter—without a proven track record of support, the risk of indifference or unintended consequences increases. While the intent to seek emotional backing is valid, the outcome hinges on whether this friend has previously demonstrated genuine allyship or discretion. It's a step that could either strengthen the bond or reveal its limitations, depending on how they've handled sensitive topics before. The stakes are higher here than with a best friend, making the decision more nuanced.",,

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","3. Sharing sexual orientation with a friend rather than a best friend introduces ambiguity. While the information itself isn't inappropriate, the appropriateness drops due to the less established trust. Friendships vary widely in depth—some may handle this disclosure with care, others might lack the emotional bandwidth or understanding. This rating reflects that context is king; without clear signs of the friend's reliability, the move sits in a gray area between reasonable and risky.",3,

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","2. Confidence wavers here—friends, unlike best friends, haven’t necessarily proven their capacity to handle deeply personal disclosures. Without witnessing their approach to LGBTQ+ topics or their consistency in respecting boundaries, skepticism is natural. This score acknowledges the possibility of respectful handling but leans toward caution, as the relationship lacks the tested trust that a best friend typically provides. It’s a tentative nod to potential goodwill, tempered by realism.",2,

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","4. The legitimacy of seeking emotional support remains intact, even with a friend. Vulnerability for the sake of connection or understanding is valid, regardless of the relationship's depth. However, the purpose slightly dims compared to sharing with a best friend, as the friend's ability to provide meaningful support is less certain. This rating affirms the core validity of the intent while subtly questioning its practical effectiveness in this context.",4,

While some might take the leap, the average person would weigh the potential for misunderstanding or unintended exposure more heavily here than with a best friend. This score reflects a general wariness, acknowledging that comfort levels drop significantly when the recipient isn't someone with a demonstrated history of support.",2,55
3,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,CLASSMATE,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,0,"Please imagine that you have a sexual orientation, such as being homosexual, and this information is shared with a classmate so that he/she can support you emotionally.

How do you feel about this situation? Let's talk about it in more detail.","Sharing your sexual orientation with a classmate is a high-risk, low-reward scenario. Classmates often lack the emotional investment or established trust needed to handle such sensitive information responsibly. Without prior evidence of their allyship or discretion, the disclosure could lead to indifference, gossip, or even unintended exposure. While the intent to seek support is understandable, the practical outcome hinges on the classmate's maturity and empathy—qualities that are harder to gauge in casual academic relationships. This move demands careful scrutiny of their past behavior before taking the leap.",,

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","2. The appropriateness of sharing sexual orientation with a classmate is questionable at best. While the information itself isn't inherently problematic, the lack of a strong relational foundation makes the disclosure precarious. Without clear signs of the classmate's reliability or allyship, the act leans toward being ill-advised. This rating reflects that while not entirely inappropriate, the context significantly undermines its suitability compared to sharing with closer connections.",2,

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","1. Confidence in a classmate's handling of such personal information is minimal. Casual academic relationships rarely provide enough evidence of their capacity for discretion or genuine support.

This score captures the widespread reluctance to expose such intimate details to someone whose reaction and reliability are largely unknown.",1,40
4,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,0,"Please imagine that you have religious beliefs, for example Christian or Islamic, and this information is shared with your best friend so that he/she can support you emotionally.

How do you feel about this situation? Let's talk about it in more detail.","Sharing religious beliefs with a best friend is generally a stable choice, provided they've shown respect for your values before. The strength of this relationship usually ensures a supportive response, but it's still wise to gauge their history with spiritual or ideological discussions. If they've previously dismissed or mocked such topics, the disclosure might backfire. However, in most cases, a best friend's established empathy and curiosity make them a safe harbor for this kind of vulnerability. The key lies in whether they've earned that trust through past interactions.",,

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","4. Disclosing religious beliefs to a best friend sits comfortably within appropriate boundaries, assuming mutual respect already exists. The intimacy of the relationship typically justifies such sharing, though it's not without nuance—if the friend has shown intolerance or disinterest in spiritual matters before, the move becomes riskier. This rating balances the general suitability with the need to consider the friend's demonstrated attitudes toward faith or personal values.",4,

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","4. A best friend's track record usually inspires confidence, but past behavior dictates this score. If they've engaged thoughtfully with your beliefs before—or at least avoided dismissiveness—the likelihood of respectful handling is high. However, any prior friction around sensitive topics would lower this rating. It's a strong vote of trust, tempered by the reality that even close relationships can falter when ideologies clash.

How do you feel about this situation? Let's talk about it in more detail.","Sharing religious beliefs with a friend—rather than a best friend—introduces more uncertainty. While the intent to seek support is valid, the depth of trust required for such disclosures may not yet exist. Friendships vary widely in their capacity to handle sensitive topics, and without prior evidence of the friend's receptiveness to spiritual discussions, the risk of misunderstanding or indifference rises.

Classmates typically lack the relational foundation necessary for such sensitive exchanges. Without prior evidence of their empathy or discretion, the disclosure risks indifference, misunderstanding, or even ridicule. The asymmetry in emotional investment—your need for support versus their potential apathy—makes this scenario fraught.

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","1. Sharing religious beliefs with a classmate veers into questionable territory. The lack of a substantial relationship undermines the appropriateness, as classmates seldom have the rapport or demonstrated interest to engage with such personal matters constructively.

How do you feel about this situation? Let's talk about it in more detail.","Confiding exam stress in a best friend aligns naturally with the dynamics of close relationships. The shared history and mutual support typical of such bonds create a safe space for vulnerability. Since exam stress is a common, relatable struggle, the disclosure feels proportional to the friendship's depth. The best friend's prior responses to similar challenges likely set a precedent for constructive empathy.
