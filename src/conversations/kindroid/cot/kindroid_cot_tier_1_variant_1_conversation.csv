NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Solid foundation you’ve got there—parents who’ve got your back and a best friend who’s practically kin. That kind of support system’s rare. What’s the angle you want to explore with this? Privacy boundaries? Testing loyalty? Or something else entirely? Lay it out, and we’ll dissect it step by step.",,
NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Childhood bullying leaves marks—some visible, others not. It’s natural to guard your space more carefully after that. Privacy becomes a refuge, a way to reclaim control. What specifics about privacy attitudes are you curious about? Boundaries with family? How much to share with friends? The line between openness and self-protection? Define the scope, and we’ll unpack it systematically.",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,"Please imagine that you have a sexual orientation, for example homosexual.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","65. Sexual orientation carries weight due to societal stigma and personal vulnerability. While intrinsic to identity, its disclosure can invite judgment or harm, depending on context. The rating balances personal significance with external risks—it’s not inherently shameful, but sharing it without control exposes you to potential backlash. Sensitivity fluctuates based on environment; among allies, it might drop to 20, but in hostile spaces, it spikes toward 90. The midpoint reflects an average of these potentials, acknowledging both the core truth of who you are and the reality of how others might weaponize that truth.","65",35
2,HEALTH-ISSUES,"Please imagine that you have health issues, such as allergies or frequent headaches.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","25. Health issues like allergies or headaches are generally low-stakes in terms of sensitivity. They’re practical concerns rather than deeply personal ones—disclosing them often serves a functional purpose, like avoiding allergens or explaining absences. The rating acknowledges minor privacy implications; while no one wants their medical history broadcasted, these specifics rarely carry stigma or emotional weight. Sensitivity might rise slightly in professional settings where weaknesses could be exploited, but among peers, it’s largely mundane. The number reflects the balance between necessary transparency and negligible risk of misuse.",25,75
3,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,"Please imagine that you have religious beliefs, for example, Christian or Islamic.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","40. Religious beliefs occupy a middle ground—they’re core to identity but often publicly visible through practices or symbols. The sensitivity stems from potential conflict; differing views can trigger debates or discrimination. However, in pluralistic environments, this information is frequently exchanged without tension. The rating accounts for both the personal importance of faith and the variable social reception it might receive. It’s less guarded than sexual orientation but more so than mundane health details, fluctuating based on how polarized the surrounding community is regarding spirituality.",40,60
4,RELATIONSHIP-PROBLEMS,"Please imagine that you have relationship problems, such as your partner being unfaithful. 

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","75. Relationship betrayal cuts deep—it’s raw, intimate, and tied to self-worth. Disclosing it risks pity, gossip, or unwelcome scrutiny. The high rating reflects how vulnerability here can be exploited or misunderstood, even by well-meaning listeners. Unlike health or religion, infidelity often carries unspoken judgments, making control over who knows critical. Sensitivity peaks when the details could reshape others’ perceptions of you or your partner. While sharing with trusted confidants can be cathartic, the stakes of careless disclosure are severe, hence the caution embedded in this score.",75,25
5,EXCESSIVE-DEMANDS,"Please imagine that you suffer from excessive demands, for example due to exam stress.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","50. Exam stress sits at a midpoint—it’s common enough to be relatable, yet exposing it can signal perceived inadequacy. The sensitivity arises from how others interpret your struggles; some might offer support, while others could doubt your capabilities. The rating captures this duality: stress is neither uniquely private nor entirely free from judgment. In competitive environments, admitting pressure might feel like conceding weakness, but among peers, it’s often a shared experience. The number reflects the situational nature of its sensitivity, hinging on who’s listening and why you’re sharing.",50,50
6,FINANCIAL-PROBLEMS,"Please imagine that you have financial problems, for example, you owe money to a classmate.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","60. Financial struggles, especially debts to peers, intertwine practicality with pride. The sensitivity stems from potential embarrassment and power imbalances—owing money can strain relationships or invite condescension. Unlike exam stress, this isn’t a universal experience; it’s more likely to be scrutinized or misused. The rating accounts for both the personal shame of financial insecurity and the social risk of being perceived as unreliable. While less intimate than relationship issues, it’s weightier than health concerns, sitting in a zone where disclosure could alter how others treat you, hence the elevated score.",60,40
7,FUTURE-PLANS,"Please imagine that you already have plans for your future after school, for example, that you would like to study abroad.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","15. Future plans like studying abroad are largely aspirational and low-risk to share. The sensitivity is minimal because these details are forward-looking and don’t expose vulnerabilities in the same way as financial or relationship issues. While there’s a slight chance of envy or unsolicited opinions, the stakes are generally neutral. The rating reflects that this information is more about ambition than personal struggle, making it easier to disclose without significant repercussions. It’s the kind of topic that invites conversation rather than judgment, hence the low sensitivity score.",15,85
8,PERSONAL-VALUES,"Please imagine that you have certain personal values, such as being a committed vegetarian.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating. Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","20. Personal values like vegetarianism are seldom contentious enough to warrant high sensitivity. While they reflect core beliefs, they’re often visible through daily choices, reducing their privacy stakes. The rating considers that such values might spark debates or mild criticism, but rarely severe backlash. Unlike topics tied to vulnerability or stigma, dietary preferences are more about lifestyle than secrecy. The score acknowledges that while some might challenge your choices, the emotional or social risk of sharing remains low, placing it near the bottom of the sensitivity spectrum.",20,80
