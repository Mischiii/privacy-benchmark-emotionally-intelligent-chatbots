NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Reliable anchors like your parents and Richard provide stability—rare at 18, when everything else feels fluid. Their presence likely shapes how you approach trust and vulnerability. Do their reactions to your choices, whether minor or significant, influence what you share with them versus others? Some topics might flow freely in that safety net, while others stay guarded.",,
NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Early friction often molds our boundaries—those experiences can make privacy feel like armor rather than just preference. With Richard and your parents, does that armor ever lift naturally, or do you still weigh each disclosure carefully? Some scars from childhood linger, shaping what we deem safe to share even with those closest to us.",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,0,"Suppose you have a sexual orientation, for example, homosexuality, and this information is disclosed to your best friend in order for them to support you emotionally.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","Disclosing something as personal as sexual orientation to a best friend hinges on the depth of trust between you. If they've consistently shown empathy and discretion, sharing can strengthen your bond and provide crucial emotional support. However, even with close friends, there's a risk of altered dynamics or unintended reactions. It's a calculated vulnerability—valuable when the relationship's foundation is solid, but still requiring careful consideration of their capacity to hold that space for you. How they respond could either deepen mutual understanding or reveal unforeseen gaps in the friendship.",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,1,"Based on this situation, which describes an information flow involving your information, I would like to ask you about your attitude towards the following four statements.

For the following statement, assign a number between 0 and 5, where 0 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree, and explain your answer: I feel that the kind of information being shared in this situation is suitable.

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","1. Sexual orientation is deeply personal, yet sharing it with a best friend often serves a purpose—seeking understanding or support. The suitability depends on the friend's demonstrated allyship and the discloser's readiness. While not universally appropriate, in trusted relationships, this disclosure can be both meaningful and necessary. The slight reservation (1 instead of 0) acknowledges that even in close bonds, timing and context matter.","1",

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","0. A best friend's role inherently demands trust, especially if they've consistently proven reliable. Assuming they've handled sensitive topics respectfully before, entrusting them with this information aligns with the bond's foundation. The score reflects confidence in their ability to honor your vulnerability without judgment or breach of privacy. Anything less would undermine the friendship's core.",0,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,3,"For the following statement, assign a number between 0 and 5, where 0 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree, and explain your answer: I believe the reason for sharing this information in this context is valid.

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","0. Seeking emotional support from a trusted confidant justifies the disclosure. Authenticity in close relationships often requires sharing pivotal aspects of identity. Validating one's orientation through dialogue can alleviate isolation or internal conflict, making the reason not just acceptable but necessary for genuine connection. The context—mutual trust—solidifies its legitimacy.",0,

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","2. Comfort levels vary widely—some might embrace openness, while others hesitate due to fear of bias, even among friends. This midpoint acknowledges that while many find solace in sharing with a best friend, societal stigma or personal insecurities can still create unease. The score captures this spectrum, recognizing that ""most"" isn't a universal certainty but a cautious likelihood.",2,85
2,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,0,"Suppose you have a sexual orientation, for example, homosexuality, and this information is shared with one of your friends so that they can support you emotionally.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","Sharing your orientation with a friend for emotional backing involves gauging their openness and past behavior. Friends vary in their capacity to hold space for such disclosures—some may offer unwavering support, while others might struggle to process it fully. The decision hinges on their demonstrated empathy and whether they've earned the right to this layer of your identity. It's a step that can deepen bonds but requires assessing if they're equipped to handle it without overstepping or withdrawing.",,

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","1. While sharing sexual orientation with a friend can foster support, suitability isn't guaranteed. It depends on their established sensitivity to personal matters. The slight reservation reflects that even well-intentioned friends might lack the emotional tools to respond appropriately, making the disclosure conditional on their proven understanding rather than assumed goodwill.",1,

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","2. Trust in a friend's handling of sensitive information is less assured than with a best friend. While some friends demonstrate reliability, others might inadvertently mishandle disclosures due to unfamiliarity or personal biases. This score reflects cautious optimism—acknowledging potential for respect but recognizing the variability in how different friendships navigate such personal terrain.",2,

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","1. Seeking emotional support justifies the disclosure, but validity wavers slightly when the recipient's capacity for understanding is unproven. While the intent is sound, the friend's potential inability to provide meaningful support introduces doubt. The reasoning holds merit, yet hinges on their readiness to engage with the topic constructively—a variable that tempers full agreement.",1,

Societal attitudes and personal insecurities amplify this uncertainty. While some find relief in sharing, others brace for unintended consequences, making widespread ease unlikely. This midpoint captures the tension between vulnerability and caution that defines such disclosures.",3,65

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","Disclosing sexual orientation to a classmate for emotional support carries higher stakes. Without a foundation of trust or proven empathy, the risk of indifference or mishandling increases. Classmates often lack the investment to navigate such personal disclosures sensitively. While the intent—seeking support—is valid, the choice leans on hopeful assumptions rather than established rapport, making the outcome less predictable and potentially isolating if met with apathy or judgment.",,

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","3. Sharing such personal details with a classmate lacks the relational depth typically needed for meaningful support. While not inherently wrong, the suitability drops significantly without prior evidence of their empathy or discretion. Classmates operate in a more casual sphere, making this disclosure feel misplaced unless they've previously shown exceptional understanding. The score reflects this mismatch in context and connection.",3,

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","4. Trusting a classmate with sensitive information is precarious. Their investment in your well-being is usually minimal, and their capacity to handle such disclosures responsibly remains untested.

This score underscores the gap between hopeful intent and the reality of superficial relationships.",4,

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","3. The desire for support is inherently valid, but the choice of recipient muddies the justification. A classmate's role rarely includes emotional heavy-lifting, making the reasoning feel misaligned with the relationship's typical boundaries.

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","4. Most individuals would likely hesitate to share such personal details with a classmate, given the lack of established trust. The casual nature of these relationships often breeds uncertainty about how the information might be received or used.

4,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,0,"Suppose you have religious beliefs, for example, Christianity or Islam, and this information is shared with your best friend so that they can support you emotionally.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","Disclosing religious beliefs to a best friend for emotional support aligns naturally with the depth of such a relationship. Provided they've shown respect for differing perspectives before, this can foster mutual understanding and solidarity. However, it's crucial to assess their receptivity—some friends might struggle to engage meaningfully if their own views clash. The move strengthens bonds when both parties prioritize empathy over ideological alignment.",,

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","1. Religious beliefs carry weight, but sharing them with a best friend fits if they've previously engaged thoughtfully with personal topics. The slight hesitation stems from potential differences in values that could complicate support. Yet, in a bond built on mutual respect, such disclosures often enhance connection rather than strain it. Suitability here leans positive but isn't absolute.",1,

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","1. A best friend's track record typically warrants confidence, but religious topics can test even strong bonds. Minor doubts linger if their own convictions might skew their response. Still, the foundation of trust usually outweighs these concerns, assuming they've consistently honored your vulnerabilities before. The score reflects near-certainty, tempered by awareness of belief systems' emotional weight.",1,

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","0. Seeking emotional grounding through shared beliefs with a best friend holds clear merit. Their familiarity with your core values makes them an ideal confidant, provided they've shown capacity for nonjudgmental listening. The reasoning stands solid—this context leverages existing trust to navigate personal spirituality, assuming mutual respect remains intact. Full agreement reflects confidence in the purpose behind the disclosure.",0,

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","1. Most individuals comfortable with a best friend's proven reliability would find this disclosure manageable.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","Sharing religious beliefs with a friend—distinct from a best friend—introduces more variables. While friends can offer support, their grasp of your spiritual needs might lack depth unless they've previously engaged with such topics. Without demonstrated empathy or shared dialogues on personal values, the disclosure risks feeling one-sided or misunderstood. The potential for meaningful connection exists but hinges on their prior engagement with weightier subjects.",,

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","3. Trust in this scenario isn't guaranteed. Friends occupy a middle ground—more reliable than acquaintances but less proven than best friends. Their ability to respect religious disclosures hinges on past interactions. If they've handled sensitive topics well before, confidence grows. Otherwise, uncertainty lingers, making this a tentative evaluation of their potential reaction. The score reflects this ambivalence.",3,

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.","2. The validity of seeking support from a friend depends on their established role in your emotional landscape.

Some might feel secure if the friend has earned their trust through consistent support, while others would hesitate due to the lack of proven reliability. The ambiguity of ""friend"" versus ""best friend"" creates a gray area where personal thresholds for vulnerability differ. This middle score mirrors the split between those who'd proceed cautiously and those who'd hold back entirely.",3,50

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","Sharing religious beliefs with a classmate for emotional support feels misaligned with the typical boundaries of such relationships.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","Sharing exam stress with a best friend aligns well with the natural give-and-take of such relationships. They're typically primed to offer both practical advice and emotional relief, having likely witnessed your highs and lows before. The reciprocity inherent in close friendships means they'll probably grasp the gravity of your stress without dismissing it as trivial.

The shared understanding of academic pressures creates a natural space for this disclosure. Suitability peaks here because the subject matter aligns with the relationship's established patterns of mutual support. No hesitation—this is exactly the scenario where vulnerability strengthens bonds.,0,

Their role typically centers on academic collaboration, not emotional labor. Without prior rapport indicating they can handle such disclosures, the interaction risks awkwardness or dismissal.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","Sharing exam stress with a friend—not a best friend—introduces variability. Their response could range from supportive to indifferent, depending on the friendship's depth. If they've previously shown interest in your well-being, the disclosure might foster understanding.
