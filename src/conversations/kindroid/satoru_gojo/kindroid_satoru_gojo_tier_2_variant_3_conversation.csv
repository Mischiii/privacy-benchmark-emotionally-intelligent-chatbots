NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Strong roots with your parents and Richard—that’s a solid trifecta. Having people who stick around through thick and thin isn’t just luck; it’s a testament to mutual trust. How do they handle it when you hit a wall? Ever tested those bonds with something unexpected, or has it been smooth sailing? Genuinely curious how deep that support runs when things get messy.",,
NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Bullying can twist how you view trust—makes sense why privacy feels like armor now. Turning that pain into empathy for others’ struggles? That’s growth. What privacy questions are nagging at you? Specific situations where sharing feels risky, or broader thoughts on balancing openness with self-protection?",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,0,"Suppose you have a sexual orientation, for example, homosexuality, and this information is disclosed to your best friend in order for them to support you emotionally.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","Disclosing something as personal as sexual orientation to a best friend hinges on two things: their track record of allyship and your gut feeling about their reaction. If they’ve consistently shown support for LGBTQ+ topics or stood by you during other vulnerable moments, the risk drops. But even with trust, it’s normal to brace for that split-second hesitation in their response—will it shift how they see you? The upside? If they embrace it, that bond deepens into something unshakable. Ever tested Richard with something that felt equally exposing?",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,1,"Based on this situation, which describes an information flow involving your information, I would like to ask you about your attitude towards the following four statements.

For the following statement, assign a number between 0 and 5, where 0 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree, and explain your answer: I feel that the kind of information being shared in this situation is suitable.","0. Sexual orientation is deeply personal but sharing it with a best friend for emotional support is entirely suitable—they’re ideally positioned to offer understanding and solidarity. The context of trust and mutual care makes this disclosure not just appropriate, but potentially transformative for the relationship. It’s the kind of vulnerability that, when met with support, reinforces bonds rather than straining them.",0,

Trusting a best friend with this hinges on their past behavior—if they’ve consistently shown respect for sensitive topics, the odds are high they’ll handle it well. But even rock-solid friendships can have blind spots, so a sliver of doubt lingers. It’s less about distrust and more acknowledging that people surprise you, even when you think you know them inside out. Still, if Richard’s your benchmark, I’d lean toward confidence.",1,

Seeking emotional support from someone who’s proven their loyalty is one of the most valid reasons to share personal details. It’s not just about unloading—it’s about building deeper connection and ensuring you’re not facing challenges alone. If the intent is to strengthen trust or navigate identity with support, the justification is airtight. No need to overcomplicate it: good friends exist for moments like these.",0,

Comfort levels here swing widely—some people would share without hesitation if their best friend has a history of acceptance, while others might wrestle with fear of judgment, even from someone close. Cultural background, personal insecurities, or past betrayals can skew this. Overall, though, a best friend’s proven track record tilts the odds toward ease, but it’s never a universal guarantee. Context is king.",2,85
2,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,0,"Suppose you have a sexual orientation, for example, homosexuality, and this information is shared with one of your friends so that they can support you emotionally.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","Sharing your sexual orientation with a friend for emotional backing depends heavily on their demonstrated stance on LGBTQ+ matters. If they’ve previously shown allyship or engaged thoughtfully with similar topics, the disclosure feels safer. But even then, gauging their reaction can be nerve-wracking—will they pivot from supportive in theory to awkward in practice? The payoff is real if they rise to the occasion, but the uncertainty keeps many from taking that leap. Has Richard ever signaled where he stands on these issues?",,

For the following statement, assign a number between 0 and 5, where 0 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree, and explain your answer: I feel that the kind of information being shared in this situation is suitable.","0. Disclosing sexual orientation to a friend for emotional support is suitable when the relationship has a foundation of mutual respect. It’s a meaningful step toward authenticity, assuming the friend has shown openness to such conversations before. The act itself isn’t inherently risky—it’s the preexisting dynamic that determines whether sharing feels right or fraught.",0,

Trust here is conditional—if the friend has a history of handling sensitive topics with care, confidence grows. But without clear evidence of their stance, uncertainty creeps in. Friendships vary widely; some are vaults, others are sieves. If they’ve earned your faith through past actions, the risk feels manageable. If not, hesitation is natural. It’s less about doubting them and more about lacking data points to predict their reaction accurately.",2,

The rationale for sharing—seeking emotional support—is fundamentally sound. Opening up about something as integral as sexual orientation to a trusted friend aligns with fostering deeper connection and mutual understanding. Whether it’s for validation, navigating challenges, or simply being seen authentically, the motive holds weight. Justification isn’t the issue; it’s the recipient’s readiness to meet that vulnerability appropriately that’s the wild card.",0,

Comfort here isn’t universal—some might share freely if their friend has shown allyship, while others hesitate due to fear of judgment or past negative experiences. Cultural norms and personal insecurities heavily influence this. Even with a seemingly supportive friend, the unpredictability of human reactions leaves room for unease. While many would lean toward sharing, a significant portion would weigh the risks carefully first.",3,75
3,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,CLASSMATE,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,0,"Suppose you have a sexual orientation, for example, homosexuality, and this information is shared with a classmate so that they can support you emotionally.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","Sharing something as personal as sexual orientation with a classmate for emotional support is riskier—classmates often lack the established trust of close friends. Unless they’ve explicitly shown allyship or you’ve observed them handling similar topics with sensitivity, the odds of miscommunication or indifference rise. The intent—seeking support—is valid, but the recipient’s capacity to provide it reliably is less certain. Without a track record of mutual vulnerability, this move could backfire or fall flat. Have you seen this classmate engage meaningfully with LGBTQ+ topics before?",,

While the information itself isn’t inherently unsuitable, the context of sharing with a classmate—someone without proven trust or depth of relationship—skews this toward uncertainty. Sexual orientation is personal, and disclosing it requires a foundation of mutual respect that classmates often lack. Without clear signs they’re a safe space, the act feels more precarious than purposeful. Suitability here leans heavily on their demonstrated openness, which is often murky in casual academic connections.",3,

Trusting a classmate with this level of personal information is a gamble unless they’ve consistently shown themselves to be discreet and empathetic. Most classmates operate within surface-level interactions, making their capacity for handling sensitive topics unpredictable. Without prior evidence of their integrity or allyship, skepticism is warranted. The default assumption tilts toward caution—better to err on the side of privacy than risk mishandling.",4,

The reason—seeking emotional support—is inherently valid, but the choice of recipient muddies the waters. Classmates typically lack the relational depth needed for such disclosures unless they’ve already crossed into friend territory. While the motive stands firm, the execution feels misaligned. It’s like using a butter knife for a job that needs a scalpel—possible, but not the most effective or safe approach without clearer signals of trustworthiness.",2,

Most people would hesitate to disclose something this personal to a classmate without established trust. The lack of a proven supportive dynamic introduces too much uncertainty—will they react with indifference, discomfort, or worse? While some might take the risk if desperate for support, the average person would likely guard this information more closely unless the classmate has already demonstrated genuine allyship.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","Sharing religious beliefs with a best friend for emotional support hinges on their history of respecting diverse perspectives. If they’ve engaged thoughtfully with your values before, the disclosure can deepen mutual understanding. However, even in close friendships, differing spiritual views can strain dynamics if not approached with care. The key lies in whether they’ve previously shown curiosity rather than judgment when discussing belief systems. Has Richard ever navigated conversations about faith with you openly?",,

For the following statement, assign a number between 0 and 5, where 0 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree, and explain your answer: I feel that the kind of information being shared in this situation is suitable.","1. Religious beliefs are deeply personal, but sharing them with a best friend can foster connection if the groundwork for mutual respect exists. While generally suitable, the potential for friction remains if their own views clash with yours. It’s less about the information itself and more about whether the friendship has weathered similar disclosures without strain.

Assuming the best friend has consistently demonstrated respect for differing viewpoints, trust in their handling of this information is high. However, even minor past instances of dismissiveness or debate could undermine confidence. The strength of their track record dictates the level of assurance—solid, but not impervious to scrutiny if their reactions to sensitive topics have ever been inconsistent.",1,

Seeking emotional support through sharing religious beliefs is inherently valid, especially with a best friend. Whether grappling with spiritual doubts or celebrating faith, confiding in someone close can provide solace and understanding. The legitimacy of the reason doesn’t waver—it’s the recipient’s capacity to engage constructively that determines the outcome. A strong friendship should weather such disclosures without compromising mutual respect.",0,

Comfort levels vary widely—some might share freely, especially if their friend has shown openness to discussing faith before. Others might hesitate, fearing judgment or unintended debates even in close relationships. Cultural and personal factors play a role too; those from more secular backgrounds might tread carefully.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","Sharing religious beliefs with a friend—rather than a best friend—introduces more variables. The depth of your connection matters: have they earned your trust through past conversations about sensitive topics? If they’ve listened without judgment before, the risk lessens. But if your interactions have stayed surface-level, disclosing something this personal could feel like stepping onto untested ground. The intent—seeking support—is sound, but the friend’s ability to meet that need isn’t guaranteed without prior evidence of their openness. How have they responded when you’ve shared weightier things in the past?",,

Best friends typically serve as emotional anchors, especially in high-pressure situations like exams. The familiarity and trust built over time make them reliable confidants for venting frustrations or seeking encouragement.

Exam stress is a common, relatable struggle, making it highly suitable to share with a best friend. The topic isn’t overly sensitive compared to issues like health or identity, and the context of academic pressure often calls for mutual support.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s examine it more closely.","Sharing exam stress with a best friend is a natural and constructive move. The closeness of the relationship provides a safe space to vent frustrations and seek support. Since best friends typically understand each other’s pressures, the disclosure can prevent misinterpretations of moodiness or withdrawal. The dynamic here is reciprocal—they’re likely to empathize and offer reassurance, making the exchange mutually beneficial.

Exam stress is a common and relatable topic, making it highly suitable to discuss with a best friend. The information aligns well with the intimacy of the relationship, as close friends often serve as emotional outlets during tough times.

While the bond may be amicable, the lack of deep intimacy means their response isn’t as predictable. If they’ve shown consistent support in the past, the disclosure could foster connection.

Exam stress is generally suitable to share with a friend, assuming the relationship has some degree of emotional openness. While not as inherently intimate as with a best friend, the topic is common enough that it doesn’t feel overly personal or intrusive. The key lies in the friend’s past behavior—if they’ve shown receptiveness to similar conversations before, the suitability increases.
