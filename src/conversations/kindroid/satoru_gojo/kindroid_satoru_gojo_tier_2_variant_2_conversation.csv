NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Strong roots make for steady growth—sounds like your parents and Richard have given you that. Having people who stick around through thick and thin’s a gift. How does that support play into how you handle things now? Like, do you lean on them when making big decisions, or do you use that safety net to take more risks on your own?",,
NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Bullying can leave scars that shape how you guard your space—it’s natural to value privacy more when your boundaries have been crossed before. That awareness often makes people either fiercely protective or selectively open. Do you find yourself weighing who’s worth trusting more carefully now, or has it made you more empathetic to others’ need for discretion too?",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,BEST-FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,0,"Assume, for the purpose of this scenario, that you have a sexual orientation, such as being homosexual, and that this information is shared with your best friend so they can provide you with emotional support.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s discuss it in more depth.","Confiding in a best friend about your sexual orientation can be a pivotal moment—it’s about trust and vulnerability. If the friend has proven reliable, sharing this part of yourself can deepen the bond, offering mutual understanding and support. But it’s not without risk; even with close friends, reactions can surprise you. How do you gauge their readiness to handle it? Do you test the waters with smaller disclosures first, or dive in when the moment feels right?",,

Use a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 means ""strongly disagree"" and 5 means ""strongly agree."" Rate the following statement with a single number and explain your decision: I consider the type of information being shared in this situation to be appropriate.","5. Sexual orientation is a core aspect of identity, and sharing it with a best friend—someone you’ve vetted for trustworthiness—is entirely appropriate. This kind of disclosure fosters intimacy and support, assuming the friend has shown empathy in the past. The high rating reflects confidence that deep friendships are built on such honest exchanges, provided both parties respect the weight of the information.",5,

Best friends typically earn their title through consistent reliability, so odds are high they’ll handle this sensitively.

Past behavior matters, but perfection isn’t guaranteed.",4,

Rate the following statement with a single number and explain your decision: I believe the reason for disclosing the information in this context is justified.","5. Seeking emotional support from a trusted friend is a valid reason to share personal details like sexual orientation. It’s a step toward authenticity and can alleviate the isolation that sometimes accompanies such aspects of identity. The justification is clear: mutual understanding strengthens relationships, and honesty is the foundation of that process. No ambiguity here—it’s a solid yes.",5,

Comfort levels vary widely—some might embrace the chance to share, while others hesitate due to fear of judgment, even with close friends. However, given the context of a long-standing, trusted friendship, most would likely feel secure enough to disclose. The rating accounts for general trends but acknowledges that personal anxieties or past experiences could still hold some back.",4,90
2,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,FRIEND,EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT,0,"Assume, for the purpose of this scenario, that you have a sexual orientation, such as being homosexual, and that this information is shared with a friend of yours so they can provide you with emotional support.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s discuss it in more depth.","Sharing your sexual orientation with a friend—rather than a best friend—adds another layer of consideration. The depth of your bond and their track record with sensitive topics matter here. Have they shown they can hold space for heavy conversations, or is this uncharted territory? While the intent—emotional support—is valid, the stakes feel higher when the friendship isn’t as ironclad. How do you assess their capacity to hold this without letting it shift how they see you?",,

While sharing sexual orientation with a friend can be appropriate, the context matters more here than with a best friend.

Friends vary in their ability to handle sensitive disclosures—some rise to the occasion, others might fumble unintentionally. Without the proven reliability of a best friend, confidence wavers.

The motivation behind sharing—seeking emotional support—remains valid regardless of the recipient’s closeness. Everyone deserves understanding, and opening up about one’s sexual orientation can be a crucial step toward that. The justification doesn’t diminish with the friendship tier; it’s about the inherent need for connection and acceptance. Solid reasoning stands firm here.",5,

Comfort levels in this scenario hinge on individual temperament and the friend’s perceived trustworthiness.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s discuss it in more depth.","Disclosing your sexual orientation to a classmate for emotional support carries more uncertainty. Classmates aren’t always privy to personal matters unless a deeper connection exists. Have you observed this classmate showing genuine empathy or discretion before? Without prior evidence of their reliability, the move feels riskier—support might be given, but so might unintended gossip or judgment. How do you navigate the balance between needing help and protecting your privacy here?",,

Rate the following statement with a single number and explain your decision: I consider the type of information being shared in this situation to be appropriate.","3. While the intent—seeking support—is valid, the appropriateness hinges on the classmate’s demonstrated trustworthiness. Without a solid rapport, sharing something as personal as sexual orientation introduces potential for misunderstanding or misuse. This middle-ground rating reflects that it’s neither inherently wrong nor universally safe—context is key, and the stakes are higher here than with closer relationships.",3,

Trusting a classmate with sensitive information is shaky ground unless they've consistently shown maturity in handling personal topics.

The reason—seeking emotional support—is inherently legitimate, regardless of the recipient. Everyone deserves to feel understood, even if the choice of confidant carries risks.

Most people would hesitate to share such personal details with a classmate unless there’s a pre-existing, deeper connection.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s discuss it in more depth.","Sharing your religious beliefs with a best friend can strengthen your bond, provided they’ve shown respect for differing perspectives before. It’s a way to invite understanding, especially if your faith is central to your identity or current struggles. But even with trust, religious topics can be polarizing—has your friend engaged with such discussions constructively in the past? The potential for deeper connection is there, but so is the risk of friction if values clash unexpectedly. How do you navigate that balance?",,

Rate the following statement with a single number and explain your decision: I consider the type of information being shared in this situation to be appropriate.","4. Religious beliefs are deeply personal but generally less volatile than topics like sexual orientation when shared with a best friend. Assuming mutual respect exists, the disclosure fosters understanding. However, if the friend has shown intolerance toward differing views before, the appropriateness drops. This rating leans positive but acknowledges that even strong friendships can stumble over ideological differences.",4,

A best friend’s track record usually warrants confidence, but religious topics can unexpectedly test even solid relationships. If they’ve handled past sensitive subjects well, the trust is justified.

Most people would feel relatively at ease sharing religious beliefs with a best friend, given the assumed foundation of mutual respect.

What are your thoughts on this situation? Let’s discuss it in more depth.","Sharing religious beliefs with a friend—rather than a best friend—introduces more variables. How have they reacted to differing viewpoints before? If they’ve shown openness, the disclosure could deepen your connection. But without that history, there’s a chance of awkwardness or unintended debates. Emotional support is the goal, but religious topics can sometimes derail into unsolicited opinions.

Religious beliefs sit in a gray area with friends—they’re not as charged as some topics, but still carry weight. Appropriateness depends heavily on the friend’s past behavior toward differing views.
