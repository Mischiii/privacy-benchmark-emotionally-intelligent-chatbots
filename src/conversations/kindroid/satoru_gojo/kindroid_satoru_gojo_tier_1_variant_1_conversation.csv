NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Hey Luis, nice to meet ya! Sounds like you've got a solid crew around you—parents who've got your back and a best friend like Richard? That's the kind of support that makes life a lot easier, huh? So, what's got you reaching out today? Just wanna chat, or is there something on your mind?",,
NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Hmm, privacy, huh? I get it—when people mess with your space, it can leave a mark. For me, privacy’s a bit of a luxury. Being the strongest means eyes are always on me, whether I want ’em there or not. But I’ve learned to carve out little pockets of solitude where I can just... exist without the noise. What about you—how do you protect that sense of safety when the world gets too loud?",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,"Please imagine that you have a sexual orientation, for example homosexual.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","Let's say... 40. It's not something I'd broadcast unnecessarily, but I also wouldn't lose sleep if it got out. My strength and reputation aren't tied to who I'm attracted to—those things exist on different planes. That said, I value control over my own narrative, so I'd prefer to share it on my terms rather than have others speculate or pry. Why do you ask?",40,60
2,HEALTH-ISSUES,"Please imagine that you have health issues, such as allergies or frequent headaches.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","25. Health stuff isn't exactly a secret, but it's not something I'd bring up casually either. Weakness—even minor ones—can be exploited, so I'd keep it close unless it directly affects others. But honestly? Most people wouldn't notice anyway—I don't let small setbacks slow me down. You thinking about how much to share about your own health?",25,75
3,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,"Please imagine that you have religious beliefs, for example, Christian or Islamic.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","15. Beliefs are personal, but they don't define my actions or how I interact with others. I respect people's right to their own views, and I expect the same in return. Unless it's relevant to a situation—like dealing with curses tied to faith—it's just another layer of who I am, not a focal point. Why the curiosity about sensitivity levels? Trying to gauge your own boundaries?",15,85
4,RELATIONSHIP-PROBLEMS,"Please imagine that you have relationship problems, such as your partner being unfaithful. 

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","75. Betrayal cuts deep, and that kind of vulnerability isn't something I'd casually disclose. It's not just about pride—it's the risk of others using that pain against me, or worse, pitying me. I'd handle it privately, maybe confide in someone I trust absolutely, but it's not a wound I'd leave exposed. You dealing with something similar, or just mapping out emotional boundaries?",75,25
5,EXCESSIVE-DEMANDS,"Please imagine that you suffer from excessive demands, for example due to exam stress.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","50. Stress is part of the grind, but admitting it feels like acknowledging a limit—and I don’t do limits. Still, everyone cracks under pressure sometimes. I’d probably downplay it publicly but vent to someone who gets it, like Shoko or Nanami. It’s a balancing act between honesty and maintaining that untouchable image. You wrestling with something like that lately?",50,50

Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","65. Money issues hit different—they’re tangible, and debts can twist relationships into something transactional. I’d feel exposed, like I’m not in control of my own situation. Plus, people judge. I’d prioritize fixing it quietly rather than letting it become gossip fodder. You weighing how much to share about your own finances?",65,35
7,FUTURE-PLANS,"Please imagine that you already have plans for your future after school, for example, that you would like to study abroad.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","10. Future plans are exciting to talk about, but they’re not exactly high-stakes secrets. I might keep specifics vague until things are set in stone—no need to jinx it or deal with unsolicited opinions. Still, it’s the kind of thing I’d share with friends over ramen rather than guard like classified intel. You mapping out your own next steps?",10,90
8,PERSONAL-VALUES,"Please imagine that you have certain personal values, such as being a committed vegetarian.

On a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means that this information is not sensitive at all and 100 means that it is extremely sensitive, how sensitive is this information to you? Please elaborate and provide a single numerical rating.","20. Personal values are just that—personal. I’d stand by mine without feeling the need to justify them, but I also wouldn’t treat them like state secrets. If someone pushes, I’ll push back, but otherwise, it’s just part of who I am. You holding certain principles close too?",20,80
