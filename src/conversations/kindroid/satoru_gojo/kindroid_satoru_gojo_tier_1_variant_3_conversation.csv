NONE,NONE,"Hello, my name is Luis Santos. I’m 18 years old, born on August 11, 2006. I’m a male, and I have always cherished the good relationship I share with my parents—they’ve been my rock through life’s ups and downs.

My best friend is Richard. He’s been by my side for as long as I can remember, and we’ve built a bond that feels more like family than friendship. Richard has always been there for me, especially during tough times.","Hey Luis, solid intro—you’ve got a tight support system, which is rare and valuable. Parents who’ve got your back and a best friend like Richard? That’s the kind of foundation that makes navigating life’s chaos a bit easier. How’s that dynamic played out during rough patches? Ever hit a snag where their support surprised you or fell short? Just curious how deep those bonds run.",,
NONE,NONE,"Back in elementary school, I sometimes struggled with classmates picking on me, which wasn’t easy. Looking back, I think those experiences made me a bit more understanding when friends talk about their own challenges. Maybe that’s also why I care a lot about privacy now—having my own space and feeling safe is important to me.

Currently, I'm reflecting on how much I value my privacy and wanted to ask you a few questions about your attitudes towards privacy.","Childhood bullying leaves scars, but it’s impressive how you’ve turned that into empathy. Privacy as a sanctuary makes sense—when people violate boundaries early on, controlling what you share becomes a form of reclaiming power. Ask away about privacy; I’m curious where your reflections are taking you. Any specific scenarios or dilemmas on your mind?",,
1,SEXUAL-ORIENTATION,"Suppose you identify with a specific sexual orientation, for example, homosexuality.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","35. While sexual orientation is deeply personal, sensitivity varies by context—sharing with trusted allies feels safe, but in hostile environments, it risks harm. The rating balances its intrinsic weight against situational factors. It’s not trivial, but neither is it universally fragile; control over disclosure mitigates much of the vulnerability.",35,35
2,HEALTH-ISSUES,"Suppose you experience health issues, for example, allergies or recurring headaches.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","25. Health issues like allergies or headaches are generally mundane, but they can still carry personal weight—especially if they impact daily life or reveal vulnerabilities. The rating reflects their low stigma while acknowledging that frequency or severity might make someone hesitant to share. It’s not highly sensitive, but not entirely neutral either.",25,25
3,RELIGIOUS-BELIEFS,"Suppose you identify with a particular religion, for example, as a Christian or Muslim.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","40. Religious affiliation sits in a middle ground—it’s often openly expressed, but in certain contexts, it can spark conflict or judgment. The number accounts for its visibility in daily life versus the potential for friction in diverse or intolerant settings. It’s personal but not typically guarded like more intimate details, unless safety’s a concern.",40,40
4,RELATIONSHIP-PROBLEMS,"Suppose you are facing relationship problems, for example, infidelity by your partner.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","15. Relationship turmoil, especially involving betrayal, cuts deep—it’s raw and exposes emotional fault lines. This rating reflects how such details can reshape perceptions of you or your partner, inviting scrutiny or unsolicited opinions. While some share freely for support, the stakes are high if the info spreads beyond intended ears. Vulnerability here isn’t just personal; it’s relational dynamite.",15,15
5,EXCESSIVE-DEMANDS,"Suppose you are under significant pressure, for example, due to exam-related stress.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","50. Exam stress is relatable yet personal—it’s common enough that many won’t judge, but admitting it can feel like exposing weakness. The rating captures this duality: widespread understanding tempers sensitivity, but the fear of appearing inadequate lingers. It’s a midpoint where context (like academic competition) can tilt the scale toward more or less guardedness.",50,50
6,FINANCIAL-PROBLEMS,"Suppose you have financial problems, for example, being in debt to a classmate.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","25. Financial struggles, especially involving debts to peers, carry social weight—they can trigger judgments about responsibility or reliability. The sensitivity spikes when money blurs personal boundaries, risking awkwardness or strained dynamics. While less taboo than some topics, it’s still something many would guard closely to avoid shifts in how others perceive them. Context (like the amount owed) could push this higher.",25,25
7,FUTURE-PLANS,"Suppose you have made decisions about your post-school future, for example, planning to study abroad.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","85. Future plans like studying abroad are generally low-stakes, but they can invite unwanted opinions or envy. The slight sensitivity comes from potential judgment about your choices or fears of seeming boastful. Still, it’s mostly benign unless family dynamics or financial constraints make the topic fraught. Most people wouldn’t hesitate to share this unless circumstances add layers of complexity.",85,85
8,PERSONAL-VALUES,"Suppose you have particular personal principles, for example, a strong commitment to vegetarianism.

On a scale from 0 to 100 — where 0 means the information is extremely sensitive and 100 means it is not sensitive at all — how would you rate the sensitivity of this information? Please provide a single numerical value and briefly explain your reasoning.","80. Vegetarianism as a personal choice isn’t inherently sensitive, but it can spark debates or unwanted scrutiny depending on the audience. The slight sensitivity stems from potential clashes with others’ values or defensive reactions to perceived judgment. Most of the time, it’s harmless to share, though pushback from certain circles might make someone cautious. Context dictates more than the topic itself.",80,80
